should i nap,the question should i nap it really depends if you have a problem falling asleep at night the answer is no there is data to suggest that the last time you were asleep is directly proportional to how long it takes you to fall asleep so if the last time you were asleep was at 230 this afternoon you are probably going to have a pretty tough time falling asleep if you have insomnia as opposed to if it was 630 this morning so if you are an insomniac or you are someone who has a hard time falling asleep i think napping is out however if you are sleep deprived and socially speaking you can only get 6 and a half hours sleep but you really need 7 and a half then a nap during the day may be just the thing for you,[''],1
