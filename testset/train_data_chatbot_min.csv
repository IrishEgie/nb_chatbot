should i nap,the question should i nap it really depends if you have a problem falling asleep at night the answer is no there is data to suggest that the last time you were asleep is directly proportional to how long it takes you to fall asleep so if the last time you were asleep was at 230 this afternoon you are probably going to have a pretty tough time falling asleep if you have insomnia as opposed to if it was 630 this morning so if you are an insomniac or you are someone who has a hard time falling asleep i think napping is out however if you are sleep deprived and socially speaking you can only get 6 and a half hours sleep but you really need 7 and a half then a nap during the day may be just the thing for you,[''],1

what causes hives,hives are produced when histamine and other compounds are released from cells called mast cells which are normally found in the skin histamine causes fluid to leak from the local blood vessels leading to swelling in the skin hives are very common although they can be annoying they usually resolve on their own over a period of weeks and are rarely medically serious some hives are caused by allergies to such things as foods medications and insect stings but in the majority of cases no specific cause for them is ever found although patients may find it frustrating not to know what has caused their hives maneuvers like changing diet soap detergent and makeup are hardly ever helpful in preventing hives and are not necessary for the most part having hives may cause stress but stress by itself does not cause hives in rare cases some hereditary others caused by bee stings or drug allergy urticaria and angioedema are accompanied by a striking decrease in blood pressure shock and difficulty breathing this is called anaphylaxis ordinary hives may be widespread and disturbing to look at but the vast majority of cases of hives do not lead to life threatening complications,['hives'],1

why it is necessary to take 2 antibiotics for a diverticuilitis infection will taking just the cipro work,the short answer is no different antibiotics treat different types of bacterial infections for example penicillin is considered a broad spectrum antibiotic because it kills a wide array of bacteria your health care provider probably prescribed two different types of antibiotics for your diverticulitis because he or she suspects there may be different types of bacteria involved in the infection by giving you two different antibiotics your provider is trying to make sure all the possible different bacteria are killed so please take both the antibiotics you were prescribed take them exactly as prescribed on the label and be sure to take all the pills do not stop taking the pills just because you start to feel better this type of behavior can contribute to the development of antibiotic resistant bacterial strains hope this helps,['diverticulitis' 'antibiotic'],1

does resveratrol really work,resveratrol which is a compound found largely in the skins of red grapes has gained a lot of media attention and has been touted as having many beneficial health effects resveratrol is a component of ko jo kon an oriental medicine used to treat diseases of the blood vessels heart and liver it came to scientific attention during the mid 90s as a possible explanation for the “french paradox” — the low incidence of heart disease among the french people who eat a relatively high fat diet since then it has been touted by manufacturers and examined by scientific researchers as an antioxidant anti cancer agent and phytoestrogen it has also been advertised online as “the french paradox in a bottle ” if you do a literature search and look at well accepted peer review journals there is very little published to support any of these effects of resveratrol new work produced by both amgen and pfizer has cast doubt on the manner in which the health supplement is said to work prominent researchers supposed that it worked by activating a certain gene sirt1 this activation is thought to produce the benefits of a caloric restriction diet even among those with high fat and high caloric intake in 2009 in chemical biology and drug design amgen scientists published experimental results that indicate resveratrol does not in fact activate sirt1 pfizer scientists in the journal of biological chemistry in 2010 offered similar results showing that resveratrol and related substances such as srt1720 do not active sirt1 and did not reduce blood sugar in mice fed a high fat diet thus it suggests that resveratrol does not work at all though it is not possible to translate mice studies into human studies despite what is promoted on many national television shows on health none of the claims has been demonstrated in any valid human study while present in other plants such as eucalyptus spruce and lily and in other foods such as mulberries and peanuts resveratrol is most abundant natural sources are vitis vinifera labrusca and muscadine grapes which are used to make wines it occurs in the vines roots seeds and stalks but its highest concentration is in the skin the resveratrol content of wine is related to the length of time the grape skins are present during the fermentation process thus the concentration is significantly higher in red wine than in white wine because the skins are removed earlier during white wine production lessening the amount that is extracted grape juice which is not a fermented beverage is not a significant source of resveratrol since wine is the most notable dietary source it is the object of much speculation and research resveratrol is also available from supplement pills and liquids in which it is sometimes combined with vitamins andor other ingredients it is also an ingredient in topical skin creams the supplements are generally labeled as containing from 20 to 500 mg per tablet or capsule however the purity of,[''],1
what is less damaging smoking 3 cigarettes per day or picking two days of the week and smoking 10 on each of those days  i know that light smoking still poses significant risks i know i can still get cancer one day from doing it so please do not answer by telling me that i am looking to significantly cut down in order to lessen the damage i am doing to myself while still indulging a little in one of my favorite activities so here are my two options a smoke about 3 cigsday about 20week or b pick 2 nightsweek say two nights when i am out socializing and smoke about 10 on each of those about 20week,i wish i could give you a good answer but i do not think researchers have studied smoking at quite that micro a level in healthcare we measure smoking by the packyear  we calculate this number based on the average number of packs smoked per day times the number of years the person has smoked for example a person who smokes one pack per day for 20 years has a 20 packyear history a person like yourself who smokes on average 20 cigarettes per week which calculates to roughly 0 15 pack per day for 20 years would have a roughly 3 packyear history    the same as a person who smoked one pack per day for three years regardless of the manner in which you smoke a lot at one time or a few spread out over a longer period you are probably doing about the same amount of damage to your lungs and other vital structures intuitively i would think the damage would be worse from smoking many cigarettes all at once as opposed to smoking the same number spread out over a greater length of time rapidly introducing a volume of carcinogens and toxins probably is worse than trickling them in you sound well informed about the risks of smoking so i will leave you with one little tidbit did you know one of the more common cancers related to smoking is bladder cancer especially in men so the next time you light up ask yourself if you can envision the day when you will be emptying your urine through a pouch strapped to your thigh if not then you might want to re think the whole smoking thing wishing you well,['smoking' 'cancer'],1

what can cause a period to be late  i am 25 have always had regular periods and i am now 3 days late i had protected sex 4 days ago i have been under a lot of stress and not sleeping well could i be pregnant or what else could cause my period to be late,the healing of a fractured bone depends on many factors 1 type of fracture   compound fractures   take much longer to heal 2 displaced bone fragments   if the bone edges and parts have been displaced then the risk of delayed union and nonunion increase 3 infection   increases the healing time 4 disruption of the blood flow to the fracture site   also hampers healing 5 malnutrition bone disorders also prolong the healing time 6 early mobilization of the joint   before complete healing in your case you have 2 or more factors which have caused the delay in your recovery without first hand knowledge of your current condition examination of your xrays and a physical examination it would not be possible to give exact possibility of your prognosis i am sorry about that but platelet rich plasma prp does contain important cytokines and growth factors which when injected into a injured area helps to improve the rate of healing bone formation in your case and hence your recovery as mentioned in your history you may already might have had some progress hence if the fractured bone site heals completely which will eventually happen in due time   there is no doubt that you will be able to walk normally on the affected foot i hope this helps,['sexual intercourse' 'period' 'stress' 'pregnancy'],-1

i brush my teeth twice daily even then my teeth are yellow what to do,with emphysema there is permanent enlargement of the alveoli due to destruction of the walls between alveoli alveoli are the thin walled sacs in the lungs where gas transfer takes place  the destruction of the alveolar walls reduces the elasticity of the lung overall this loss of elasticity leads to the collapse of the bronchioles the small airways leading to the alveoli obstructing airflow out of the alveoli air becomes trapped in the alveoli and reduces the ability of the lung to shrink during exhalation the reduced expansion of the lung during the next breath reduces the amount of air that is inhaled as a result less air for the exchange of gases gets into the lungs this trapped air also can compress adjacent less damaged lung tissue preventing it from functioning to its fullest capacity the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen between the air and the blood in the capillaries takes place across the thin walls of the alveoli destruction of the alveolar walls decreases the number of capillaries available for gas exchange this adds to the decrease in the ability to exchange gases usually energy is required only for inhalation to inflate the lungs the stretch of the lungs and distension of the chest cavity springs back to rest during exhalation a passive process that does not require energy however in emphysema extra effort and energy has to be expended to empty the lungs of air due to the collapse of the airways this essentially doubles the work of breathing since now energy is required for both inhalation and exhalation in addition because of the reduced capacity to exchange gases with each breath due to the collapse of the bronchioles and loss of capillaries it is necessary to breathe more frequently,['dental scaling'],-1

diabetic man had leg injury antibiotics not working,vitiligo is an autoimmune condition and what that means is that for some reason your own body is immune system decides that the pigment forming cells that give your skin color do not belong to you and they attack it and they tend to do this in a very patchy and predictable way the first place we start to see vitiligo in most people is around the eyes around the mouth and then on areas of high friction like the hands or even the elbows so that is what causes it we know the underlying cause it is not a mystery there is no cure for it that we know of but there are ways to mask it there are products like dermablend that you can put on and you can match your own natural skin color to try to conceal it there are some treatments that we try as dermatologists to help with it sometimes using a product called a psoralen which can be either by mouth or topical applied to the skin you let it incubate for a little while and then go under ultraviolet light in a light box can stimulate those pigment forming cells to come back to life and suppress the immune system in the skin in those areas to try to help the pigment come back sometimes this works sometimes it does not when the vitiligo is extensive enough that it covers more of the body than not so if it is very patchy if there is a big contrast in skin color we can use a topical cream called benoquin to try to eliminate all the pigment forming cells and take away all the pigments so sometimes we try to bring the pigment back and sometimes we try to take it all away but in the meantime trying to cover it may be the best thing in rare cases it just fades out on its own i use low dose naltrexone for my autoimmune illness and belong to a group in face book about ldn so i say research ldn for vitiligo many sites on google> about it good luck there is also a skin dye called dy o derm that you can use to dye small spots this works better for people who have more olive colored skintones i ordered it off the internet i understand a lot of weight lifters use it as  notan for their skin it contains acetone and my skin kind of objected to it after using it for a long time we have nearly finished our supply of dy o derm which we found to be a very effective stain for small exposed areas of skin e g hands and less messy longer lasting than the camouflage creams we use for larger areas unfortunately it was taken off the market several months ago and is no longer available as you will see if you try to order it from amazon i believe there were some concerns,['antibiotics not working'],-1

what causes razor bumps and what i do about them,from a man is perspective the number one skin care problem would be ingrown hairs as a result of shaving when guys shave they scrape their face with a very sharp metal object this could be an electric or a manual blade razor the razor cuts each whisker leaving a sharp and often angled end facial hair is much coarser than the hair on the rest of your body as a result it has a tendency to curl just a bit when you cut each hair during your daily shave the razor leaves a very sharp end to each whisker hair when this hair grows just a little bit it tends to curl on itself pierces the skin and embeds itself into your skin this results in razor bumps and some of them will end up inflamed and infected how do you take care of this try the following suggestions · first when you shave i recommend a manual razor with a single blade the double and triple blades promise to give you a very close shave this sounds good but the closer you shave the more likely you are to have those hairs curling below the surface of your skin resulting in razor bumps and infected hairs · secondly shave in the shower by having your face very wet you minimize the likelihood of developing razor burn from too much friction · use a good lubricating shave cream or gel trial and error is my suggestion here no single product works for every person · after shaving make sure you moisturize your face no you do not have to use the perfumed products of your sweetheart there are very good men is products out there find one you like and use it every day · lastly when you shave shave in the direction your hair grows when you shave against the direction of your hair growth you may get a closer shave but you will increase the likelihood of developing ingrown hairs,[''],1

what is the best skin lightening cream i am darker skinned,to brighten your skin first you have to understand what made it darker to begin with typically that is something called inflammation that inflammation can be from something that irritated your skin like a product you used that your skin did not like and that caused a reaction that made it red and then the red can heal towards brown before it fades away or from a pimple or acne or rosacea or it can be from sun exposure where your skin makes a tan even people with skin of color can still make a tan and what that often looks like is skin that is more blotchy or uneven if you are taking an oral contraceptive pill and go in the sun that can cause a blotchy uneven skin tone called melasma so we use brightening creams to help lighten this the gold standard brightening cream is a product or an ingredient called hydroquinone and this i prefer to be given by the dermatologist because we like to have control over the concentration of the product that is used and how long it is used for hydroquinones can also be combined with over the counter ingredients that work really well like sepiwhite liquorice extract or mulberry root extract and that combined with antioxidants like niacinamide and green tea or grape tea extracts or grape seed extracts or things like caffeine can also have an added benefit to your skin in helping even out the skin tone without bleaching your skin that is the word i do not like using these are brighteners and not bleaches,['skin'],1

is there evidence that statins increase life expectancy for people without heart disease,treatment of acute viral hepatitis and chronic viral hepatitis are different treatment of acute viral hepatitis involves relieving symptoms and maintaining adequate intake of fluids treatment of chronic viral hepatitis involves medications to eradicate the virus and taking measures to prevent further liver damage acute hepatitis in patients with acute viral hepatitis the initial treatment consists of relieving the symptoms of nausea vomiting and abdominal pain careful attention should be given to medications which can have adverse effects in patients with abnormal liver function only those medications that are considered necessary should be administered since the impaired liver is not able to eliminate drugs normally and drugs may accumulate in the blood and reach toxic levels in addition sedatives and tranquilizers are avoided because they may accentuate the effects of liver failure on the brain and cause lethargy and coma the patient must abstain from drinking alcohol since alcohol is toxic to the liver it occasionally is necessary to provide intravenous fluids to prevent dehydration caused by vomiting patients with severe nausea andor vomiting may need to be hospitalized for treatment and intravenous fluids chronic hepatitis treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis b and hepatitis c usually involves medication or combinations of medications to eradicate the virus doctors believe that in properly selected patients successful eradication of the viruses can stop progressive damage to the liver and prevent the development of cirrhosis liver failure and liver cancer alcohol aggravates liver damage in chronic hepatitis and can cause more rapid progression to cirrhosis therefore patients with chronic hepatitis should stop drinking alcohol smoking cigarettes also can aggravate liver disease and should be stopped medications for chronic hepatitis c infection include injectable interferon oral ribavirin medications for chronic hepatitis b infection include injectable interferon oral lamivudine epivir oral adefovir hepsera oral entecavir baraclude decisions regarding treatment of chronic hepatitis can be complex and should be directed by gastroenterologists or hepatologists doctors specially trained in treating diseases of the liver for several reasons including the diagnosis of chronic viral hepatitis may not be straightforward sometimes a liver biopsy may have to be performed for confirmation of liver damage doctors experienced in managing chronic liver diseases must weigh the risk of liver biopsy against the potential benefits of the biopsy not all patients with chronic viral hepatitis are candidates for treatment some patients need no treatment since some patients with chronic hepatitis b and c do not develop progressive liver damage or liver cancer medications for chronic infection with hepatitis b and hepatitis c are not always effective prolonged treatment 6 months to years often is necessary even with prolonged treatment rates of successful treatment defined as complete and lasting eradication of the virus often are low usually less than 80 and often around 50 some of the medications such as interferon and ribavirin can have serious side effects and doses may have to be reduced there are several different strains of hepatitis c viruses with differing susceptibilities to medications for example hepatitis c,['heart disease'],-1

can a round object travel up from your rectum into your colon and get stuck,it is an interesting question if an object of any size or shape gets inserted into the rectum it can get stuck or as we like to say in medicine retained due to the strength of the external anal sphincter this is the powerful muscle that enables us to hold in or release stool when an object slips beyond the anal sphincter it can be very hard to get out you might be surprised how many people go to the emergency room each year to have a foreign object removed from the rectum however it is unlikely an object would travel up the bowel and deeper into the colon in the first place peristalsis a rhythmic contraction of muscles along the digestive tract naturally propels the contents of the intestines toward the anus for a foreign object to move against the effects of peristalsis would be akin to a salmon swimming upstream that is not to say it absolutely could not happen i guess never say never wishing you well,['travel' 'rectum' 'colon'],1

how is a damaged earlobe that had been pierced repaired,today with a wide array of products medications injections and skin treatments cosmetic plastic surgery is not the only route to looking younger and better the earlobes are pretty nifty gadgets they are utilitarian they can be pierced so that studs or earrings can be passed through the channel or earrings can be clipped on nature had a good idea to facilitate wearing jewelry sometimes the earlobes get into a little trouble for those with rather thin lobes who favor wearing heavy earrings after the lobes have been pierced there can be a gradual elongation of the ear piercing tract such that it becomes slit like and often too large another problem is that the earlobes can be torn by accident if undue pressure is placed upon an already elongated ear piercing tract through the natural forces of the heavy earring or even by a playful child tugging on a dangling earring the repair of such is not simple it is important that it be well done so that the earlobe looks normal and without overt evidence of having been torn and then repaired we favor a three layer repair done under hypermagnification it is an office procedure done under local anesthesia but it is very important to remove the damaged ear piercing tract or to trim the edges of a cleft if the earlobe has been torn through completely then the three layer closure consists of closing the outer layer of skin the fatty tissue between the two layers of the skin and finally skin in the back of the lobe typically the surgery must take great pains to avoiding any notching at the bottom of the earlobe such a repair is all technique dependent the surgeon needs to have the skill the experience and the patience to do a first class job people ask if the ears can be pierced again they can typically you should wait two months after the lobe has been repaired before initiating a repaired earlobe piercing,['injury'],1

i underwent cardiac ablation for tachycardia i now have episodes of heart vibrating,i am happy to help you understand this buncreatinine is a combination of laboratory tests that measure your kidney function bun stands for blood urea nitrogen  the test looks basically looks at your kidneys ability to filter the naturally occurring waste product urea from your blood if you have a high level of urea in your blood then your kidneys may not be working well the creatinine lab test measures how much creatinine another naturally occurring waste product is in your blood the kidneys should filter creatinine very efficiently so a high creatinine level could mean your kidneys are not functioning well the lab result you are asking about buncreatinine ratio basically tells whether or not your are dehydrated when a person is severely dehydrated his or her bun level will rise more than the creatinine level in your case your buncreatinine ratio is 24 that is barely above the high end of the reference range normal range this means you could be mildly dehydrated but basically you seem to be fine wishing you well,['i underwent cardiac ablation for tachycardia'],-1
social anxiety i want friends where do i go i have such bad social anxiety when i first get to know someone but then it lessens,individuals afflicted with social anxiety tend to worry about being judged by others especially peers there may be feelings of being rejected coupled with a lack of self esteem as a young child this trait is probably rooted in our genetics and protective in nature it is part of the normal growth and development process children in this stage may be referred to as being shy most young children and adolescents outgrow this condition as they enter into adulthood where you go to meet friends is wide open depending on your age some places to meet friends may include school clubs sporting activities the work place and church to name a few volunteering to help others is a great way to meet new people while contributing to the community think about joining a speech club many members of these clubs start out feeling nervous about engaging in public speaking activities and possibly to speaking in smaller social settings these club members are usually very supportive and enjoy helping newer participants overcome their speaking fears by developing overall self confidence take a personal inventory to determine outside  of  the  house activities that you enjoy and look for an opportunity to participate many local newspapers dedicate column space to advertising upcoming neighborhood events and meetings yes some individuals with social anxiety tendencies may best respond to talk therapy andor medication but overcoming social anxiety disorder is a process that involves having a small number of interpersonal interactions triumphs and building on their success practice looking people in the eye and greeting them warmly say good morning to neighbors colleagues at school and work and even to people at the grocery store while waiting in line the risks are worth the rewards these positive experiences tend to promote a sense of confidence from that added confidence we tend to develop more competence in our social exchanges the pay off of your risk taking is that a nice positive circle of social interactions should occur your self image and self esteem will improve resulting in a more enriched life,['anxiety'],1

i am a 25 year old female and yesterday got a sharp pain under my right breast and it goes into my back what is wrong  it hurts especially when i bend over,that is a controversy i have many patients including physicians as adults who have been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they are hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it is almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off some men will tell you that they do not feel any more or less after the circumcision some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that do not like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it is social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place there are risks to the surgery in good hands those risks are minimal but they can not be eliminated so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well great product hope this helps,['pain' 'breast'],-1

what is acid reflux also known as gerd,gastroesophageal reflux disease commonly referred to as gerd or acid reflux is a condition in which the liquid content of the stomach regurgitates backs up or refluxes into the esophagus the liquid can inflame and damage the lining cause esophagitis of the esophagus although visible signs of inflammation occur in a minority of patients the regurgitated liquid usually contains acid and pepsin that are produced by the stomach pepsin is an enzyme that begins the digestion of proteins in the stomach  the refluxed liquid also may contain bile that has backed up into the stomach from the duodenum the duodenum is the first part of the small intestine that attaches to the stomach  acid is believed to be the most injurious component of the refluxed liquid pepsin and bile also may injure the esophagus but their role in the production of esophageal inflammation and damage is not as clear as the role of acid gerd is a chronic condition once it begins it usually is lifelong if there is injury to the lining of the esophagus esophagitis this also is a chronic condition moreover after the esophagus has healed with treatment and treatment is stopped the injury will return in most patients within a few months once treatment for gerd is begun therefore it usually will need to be continued indefinitely although it is argued that in some patients with intermittent symptoms and no esophagitis treatment can be intermittent and done only during symptomatic periods in fact the reflux of the stomach is liquid contents into the esophagus occurs in most normal individuals one study found that reflux occurs as frequently in normal individuals as in patients with gerd in patients with gerd however the refluxed liquid contains acid more often and the acid remains in the esophagus longer it has also been found that liquid refluxes to a higher level in the esophagus in patients with gerd than normal individuals as is often the case the body has ways mechanisms to protect itself from the harmful effects of reflux and acid for example most reflux occurs during the day when individuals are upright in the upright position the refluxed liquid is more likely to flow back down into the stomach due to the effect of gravity in addition while individuals are awake they repeatedly swallow whether or not there is reflux each swallow carries any refluxed liquid back into the stomach finally the salivary glands in the mouth produce saliva which contains bicarbonate with each swallow bicarbonate containing saliva travels down the esophagus the bicarbonate neutralizes the small amount of acid that remains in the esophagus after gravity and swallowing have removed most of the liquid gravity swallowing and saliva are important protective mechanisms for the esophagus but they are effective only when individuals are in the upright position at night during sleep gravity is not in effect swallowing stops and the secretion of saliva is reduced therefore reflux that occurs at night is more likely to,['heartburn'],1

sprained left ankle for a year and a half ligament injury synovitis with effusion,the whole idea of having heart stents done is to allow you to lead a full and active life it is very common for patients who have had heart surgery to be afraid to engage in normal activities one excellent way to get back into an exercise program is through cardiac rehabilitation cardiac rehab as it is often called is a customized program of exercise and education many programs involve not only monitored exercise but also provide nutritional counseling emotional support and education about lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of heart problems if cardiac rehab is not appropriate or possible then discuss your specific exercise goals with your doctor physical activity is so important for your wellbeing a physical exercise program should incorporate 4 basic types of exercises the exercises should include aerobic exercise muscle strengthening flexibility and balance an adult should spend at least 30 minutes in aerobic exercise on five or more days of the week but this is a minimum amount and more is definitely better the good news is that is does not have to be done all at once three 10 minute walks are just as good as one 30 minutes walk depending on your other health issues you will want to pick an aerobic exercise that does not cause problems elsewhere in your body such as your joints that is why swimming bike riding and walking work better for many adults rather than running weight lifting is another important part of an exercise program woman especially benefit by weight training in maintaining strong bones yoga is a wonderful way to work on flexibility and balance yoga not only helps with these elements it can reduce your stress levels but research has shown that exercising alone can not wipe out the damage done if you sit all day long humans were not designed to be as sedentary as modern life now dictates it is important to move throughout the day to be really healthy obviously diet and weight are also key elements in your recovery from cardiac stent surgery consulting with a dietician is very helpful in learning to eat healthy keeping a diary of all the foods that you eat for 3 days or more can also be enlightening taking off those extra pounds if you are overweight and watching your cholesterol intake needs to be on your program we know from research studies on obese patients who were at risk for diabetes that losing 5 to 7 of their total body weight delayed and possibly prevented diabetes diabetes is a major risk factor for heart disease as is high blood pressure and small amounts of weight loss can significantly improve your health you do not have to look like a model to be healthy so ask your doctor for specific recommendations to help you on your way to a healthier lifestyle,['ligament injury synovitis with effusion'],-1

how was maximum heart rate determined  your target heart rate calculator page claims to calculate the highest safe heart rate during exercise using the formula 220 minus age for maximum heart rate i thought haskell and fox made up that formula in 1970 from 11 experimental studies of maximum attainable heart rate and no subjects were harmed in these experiments if that is so that formula has nothing to do with safety am i right if not what studies were used to determine what heart rate is safe,you are right in that the 220 – age formula to calculate maximum heart rate is outdated and does not hold much merit this particular formula was developed by william haskell in 1970 and he openly acknowledges that he did not use a very representative sample and that it was only meant to be used as a rough estimate there have been many other studies that have attempted to develop a maximum heart rate formula since haskell developed the 220 – age formula in 1970 the only problem is that i do not believe there is a consensus in regards to which among those is the most appropriate formula to use there have even been other formulas developed that attempt to distinguish between males and females and others that differentiate between athletes and non athletes the 220 – age is the easiest method of calculation for maximum heart rate applicable to the general population though it is certainly not the most accurate there are other formulas developed by different researchers but i do not believe that there is a clear consensus in regards to which is the most accurate or the best replacement,['exercise' 'target heart rate'],1

for the last month i have had pain on both sides of my ribs on the back side,the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle depending on the brand you need to read the box you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin hcg in your urine this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect so step one wait until you miss your period step two home pregnancy test hope this helps i had an accurate positive home test 2 weeks after conception with my 2nd child so yes it is possible if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed thats what i did,['pain on both sides of my ribs'],-1

what is prostate cancer,brain surgery may be considered when drugs fails to control symptoms of parkinson is disease or cause severe or disabling side effects deep brain stimulation  dbs  is a technique for treating parkinson is disease it affects movement by using electrical impulses to stimulate a target area in the brain the electrical impulses are generated by wire electrodes surgically placed in the brain deep brain stimulation may be used in addition to therapy with levodopa or other drugs when drugs alone do not control symptoms adequately this technique is the preferred surgical method of treating most cases of advanced parkinson is disease it does not destroy brain tissue and has fewer risks than older more destructive surgical methods such as pallidotomy and thalamotomy 6 deep brain stimulation dbs neither cures parkinson is disease nor eliminates the need for medicine dbs of the thalamus is done to treat disabling tremor caused by parkinson is disease procedures that stimulate the subthalamic nucleus and the globus pallidus control a wider range of symptoms in addition to tremor and are used more often than stimulation of the thalamus pallidotomy and thalamotomy are rarely done anymore they involve the precise destruction of very small areas in the deep part of the brain that cause symptoms neurotransplantation surgery is an experimental procedure being studied for the treatment of parkinson is disease it involves implanting cells that produce dopamine into the brain information about the effectiveness of neurotransplantation is limited and it is not a proven treatment or a realistic option for most people at this time surgery choices deep brain stimulation pallidotomy thalamotomy neurotransplantation what to think about a neurologist with special training in parkinson is disease is most often the best kind of doctor to make a decision about surgery if you might benefit from surgery or deep brain stimulation your neurologist can refer you to a brain surgeon with experience doing these operations surgery most often becomes a treatment option for people when parkinson is disease progresses to the point that drugs can no longer control symptoms adequately with advanced disease existing symptoms may get worse or a person may develop new symptoms that drugs cannot control however when a person has severe one sided tremor deep brain stimulation [dbs] may be considered much sooner because this symptom often responds better to dbs than to medicine  people who have extremely advanced parkinson is or who have other serious conditions such as heart or lung disease cancer or kidney failure  are not usually good candidates for surgery surgery is usually not considered for people who have dementia or psychiatric disorders surgery is not a cure for parkinson is disease drugs are usually still necessary after surgery but surgery can reduce the number and amount of drugs needed to control symptoms this reduces the side effects caused by drugs while at the same time controlling symptoms webmd medical reference from healthwise this information is not intended to replace the advice of a doctor,['prostate cancer'],-1

experiencing right sided facial palsy for the 3rd time in 8 months,unfortunately you cannot spot reduce or target a specific area of your body for fat reduction it would be nice if you could get on the elliptical machine and say okay burn fat from my thighs today or okay sit ups get rid of my love handles  but that is not how it works instead fat is stored in special fat cells called adipocytes which are located all over your body the trick to reducing fat and losing weight is to stimulate adipocytes to release their stored fat and have the muscles burn it up exercise will do that for you and here is how it works when you start to exercise hormones like norepinephrine adrenaline are released into the bloodstream and transported via the circulation to adipocytes all over the body when these hormones reach the adipocytes they trigger special chemical messengers that instruct the adipocytes to release fat and just like a balloon that shrinks when you let air out of it adipocytes shrink when they release fat the released fat then circulates in the blood to the muscles which burn it up for fuel just like an automobile engine burns gasoline for fuel you lose weight when adipocytes release their stored fat and shrink and muscles burn up the fat as for spot reducing you can not do it because you have no control over which adipocytes release fat when you start to exercise we all have a consistent pattern of weight loss and weight gain you may lose fat in your face first and your love handles last but you can not control the pattern the good news is that all aerobic exercise stimulates adipocytes to give up their fat including the ones in your love handles and resistance exercises like weightlifting and abdominal exercises will tone up muscles under excess fat in fact you could tighten up your waist and loosen your slacks with abdominal exercises even if you did not lose your love handles to maximize the health and fitness benefits of exercise build up to three to five times per week of aerobic exercise for 30 minutes a session and perform resistance exercise two to three times per week all abdominal exercises on the floor will help try side bends trunk rotations and full body exercises like squats to help tone up the waist as always if you have not exercised in a while check with your doctor before beginning any exercise program,['facial palsy'],-1

can anyone give more information on primary cutaneous neuroendocrine merkel cell carcinoma  my brother in law has been diagnosed with a rare type of cancer and i am looking for information on how this is treated and success rates for chemo treatment ,you have to differentiate between what is likely and what is theoretically possible and what is the worst possible scenario if the thing that you do not want to happen happens for example it is normally accepted that people do not catch measles twice when we catch an infection we make antibodies to fight that infection and to prevent us from catching it again that said it is possible to find people who have caught measles twice so it is not impossible in the case of herpes simplex the virus is usually caught on one part of the body we even give it a different name if it is caught in a different place genital herpes or cold sore or whitlow on the finger or hand though the virus may be confined to one dermatome our antibodies cover the whole body and usually prevent reinfection on different sites in other words our bodies are primed to prevent reinfection if reinfection does unusually happen it tends to happen to people whose immune systems are weakened by other infections or conditions and not to average healthy individuals if reinfection does take place and i stress it is rare then you will have caught a cold sore on the lip around three quarters of adults have caught a facial cold sore infection by middle age and most of them notice little or nothing in the way of symptoms or recurrences let is not get hysterical about the common cold sore shedding is most likely to be happening in the first year or so and declines thereafter by its very nature shedding is virus on the skin at a low level so is unlikely to be present in sufficient quantity to overwhelm the immune system on a different part of the body of a person who already has antibodies,['cancer' 'skin' 'merkel cell carcinoma'],-1

if you have unprotected sex on nov 3 is it possible to tell with a home test that you are pregnant on the 18th,the answer to this question lies in your individual menstrual cycle depending on the brand you need to read the box you can take a home pregnancy test as early as a day after you miss your period some tests claim you can test 3 to 4 days before you miss your period but testing too soon can give you a false negative result it may be better to wait the few extra days to see if you miss your period and then test for best results i suggest taking the test first thing in the morning when your urine is most concentrated home pregnancy tests measure the level of human chorionic gonadatropin hcg in your urine this hormone is produced in great quantities beginning shortly after fertilization of an egg occurs by taking the pregnancy test first thing in the morning you ensure any hcg in your urine is very concentrated and easy for the test to detect so step one wait until you miss your period step two home pregnancy test hope this helps i had an accurate positive home test 2 weeks after conception with my 2nd child so yes it is possible if it comes back positive best thing to do is go to the doctor and get it confirmed thats what i did,['pregnancy'],1

what are the long term effects of hypothermia if you have exposure to low temperatures either by being out in the cold a lot during winter working in a meat freezer without protection or just living on the breadline not being able to pay for heating there is a greater chance of hypothermic reaction for instance blood thickens and clots form   so you survive day to day but then after a while you cant breathe as clots travel to the lungs or brain and you have a stroke is this right   common   or just missed by most people and shrugged off,i have never heard that people who routinely live in cold temperatures eventually habituate and their bodies get used to it your blood does not get thicker if you are cold blood gits thicker if there is an over production of platelets or if there is some other issue with the blood even in a cold area your body is still somewhere in the neighborhood of 98 degrees because your body burns fuel to keep itself warm people in ancient japan for example regularly lived in unheated homes with only a charcoal brazier and thick quilts on the bed in winter they tended to be quite healthy the human body is amazingly adaptable,['long-term effect' 'hypothermia' 'exposure' 'coldness' 'cold'],1

how can i let someone know i am upset or want for them to change what they are doing without losing our relationship,there is no sure fire answer that can get the results you want without the risk of conflict or loss but there are ways of thinking about your situation and approaching it that can help know your own experience if you think about your situation as a problem to be solved then it becomes evident that you can benefit from understanding the problem well this means understanding what you are feeling thinking and hoping for both in the sense of what you want more of and what you would like less of begin with a positive all discussions about problems can benefit from starting with the positive so begin by stating what you value about your relationship and how you would like to make it even better share your experience by only briefly describing their behavior or the circumstance but truly focusing on your experience you invite the other person into your intimate space making yourself vulnerable in this way tends to elicit a caring response from people who truly do care about you if on the other hand you talk about all the things the other person is doing wrong they will most likely defend themselves by either shutting you out or attacking you listen to their experience ask how the situation and what you are saying affects them make sure you take the time and invest the effort to understand their perspective be aware that particularly if they are very upset you might need to listen to their response to the current situation before they can really hear what you have to say about your experience ask for what you want restate what you value about your relationship and how you would like to make it even better be clear about how you would like the situation or their behavior to be different and explain how you will both benefit from this change,[''],1

how does psychotherapy work is it more than just about venting your feelings,most patients think that they sign up for psychotherapy and they go in and talk in order to “vent” their feelings others think they are going it to see a counselor like a lawyer or financial advisor who will tell them what to do and how to behave some of this is true venting your feelings or “getting it all out” in a safe environment may be helpful in cases of grief where a loved one has died but i have also met patients who have had therapists where they have been venting every week for seven years… and they still are not better so venting is part of the process in some cases some therapists will tell you what to do and how to behave but this may not be a hallmark of a good therapist good therapists work with you in hopes that you see better ways to behave interact and function and act on those in your own way below are some concepts that govern certain types of psychotherapy yes just like there are several types of medications that work in several different ways there are different types and styles of psychotherapy analytical or psychodynamic therapy suggests that your past your parents your upbringing your environment your friends and all of the good and bad things that ever happened to you shapes who you are and dictates how you behave in the present if you learn about yourself and your past then gain insight into your patterns and behaviors you can learn to react differently in the future and your symptoms will gradually improve cognitive behavioral psychotherapy cbt suggests that patients have developed automatic negative and self defeating thoughts cbtdoes not care if problems came from your parents or elsewhere but cares that in the ‘here and now that you are suffering as your automatic thoughts for example i always fail i am never any good everyone always abandons me trigger negative emotions sadness anger despondency which you get stuck in and become depressed or anxious cbt therapists teach skills and resiliency in regards to fighting through and counteracting these negative automatic thoughts there are likely 20 other forms of psychotherapy each with their own underlying theory and process of reducing psychiatric symptoms,['psychotherapy'],1

can gas cause chest pain,yes chest pain has many possible causes some are harmless but some like a heart attack can be life threatening part of the problem is that the heart and other internal organs have a type of sensory nerve conduction where it is sometimes difficult to precisely pinpoint the exact origin of a painful sensation pain due to something wrong in the heart lungs or belly can be vague or feel like something else this is why chest pain can be such a difficult problem for those who have it as well as for their doctors gas causes swelling in the intestines and a bloated feeling when gas causes pain it is usually in the abdomen belly however the pain may also be felt in the chest if pain is due to gas it should go away within a short time other causes of chest pain not due to the heart include problems with the esophagus gastroesophageal reflux disease gerd musculoskeletal chest wall pain problems in the lungs and many others studies have shown that even doctors have a hard time identifying the cause of chest pain just through conversation or physical examination laboratory tests a chest x ray and an electrocardiogram are generally needed to know for sure that chest pain is nothing serious no one wants to call 911 or sit in an emergency room to be treated for what turns out to be gas pain however playing a waiting game when you are having chest pain can be a gamble with your health or maybe your life if you are having chest pain in almost all cases a doctor is recommendation will be to seek medical attention yes thanks i have been having a chest pain and thru my underarm since early this morning i am scared it could be a heart attack then again i have experienced this pain before but does not last as long as it has today it gets worse when i lay down could it be gas or should i go to the emergency room yes yes,['chest' 'flatulence' 'pain'],1

what is worse a laceration or a skin avulsion,cryotherapy is one of the newer treatments that is being evaluated for use in the early stage of prostate cancer this treatment kills the cancer cells by freezing them the freezing is accomplished by inserting a freezing liquid for example liquid nitrogen or argon through needles directly into the prostate gland the procedure is accomplished under the guidance of ultrasound images actually cryotherapy is not a new technique rather it is a modification of a procedure that was tried previously but had an unacceptably high rate of complications thus cryotherapy was used in the 1960s to freeze the lining of the stomach to treat ulcers but was discontinued because it also severely damaged the lining of the stomach at present cryotherapy is recommended for patients with locally advanced prostate cancer who for whatever reason are not candidates for the more established treatments cryotherapy is further being studied to determine which other patients might benefit from this treatment for example studies are under way to establish whether cryotherapy is beneficial as an initial treatment for organ confined localized prostate cancer the effectiveness of cryotherapy in eliminating prostate cancer however has not yet been proven we do know that sometimes the freezing liquid fails to kill all of the cancer cells moreover the potential side effects of this treatment include damage to the urethra and bladder this damage can cause obstruction blockage of the urethra fistulas abnormal tunnels that leak urine or serious infections,['skin'],-1

my daughter is blood tests show some scary diseases and syndromes online,most helpful answer based on your story you are highly highly unlikely to get pregnant in this way sperm may look like tadpoles but they do not remain viable for very long in the mouththroat and any expectorate that flowed past your genital area in the shower an hour later would not have the potential of cause you to become pregnant swallowed semen cannot result in a pregnancy and even if there was a stray super sperm that flowed past your vaginal area it would be a one in a zillion chance that it would squiggle up your vagina through your uterus and make it to a viable egg assuming your were ovulating at the time you are engaging in sexual activity which tends to escalate to more risky behavior in the future so you would be wise to use effective contraception from now on,"['""my daughters blood tests show some scary diseases and syndromes online""']",-1

can conjunctivitis in your eye happen from a common cold  have had a common cold that started 6 days ago woke up this morning with my eye stuck shut from discharge is this caused by my cold or do i need to see a doctor for medication from what i have read it sounds like this might be something that will clear up on it is own since i am pretty sure it is related to my cold,it is probably not so much the shampoo as it is the water that is affecting your hair color i have actually inquired from a lot of different companies and most of the shampoos if you look at head & shoulders for example does not affect your hair color so that is something that is very important to understand but what happens is when you color your hair the hair can become more porous and that means that everything you do to your hair can affect it more so sun exposure will make your hair more brassy and more dry because the sun also dries out your skin and takes the water out of your skin and your hair as well as well as the ultraviolet rays changing the color so that is something you want to be careful about do not stay in the shower for too long and do not let the water just run over your hair for more than ten minutes at a time use a conditioner and a shampoo that are specifically designed for color treated hair because they will coat the hair and give it some strength and volume and help protect that color from fading over time but it is more the water than the shampoo that is the culprit,['cold' 'pink eye' 'eyes' 'vision' 'coldness'],-1

how effective is the seasonal flu vaccination,most helpful answer thanks for providing all the great background information if several different doctors have told you the blemish is a cyst then that is probably accurate a cyst is a pocket of tissue that is filled with some type of fluid the type of fluid can vary depending on the type of cyst some are filled with fatty acids while others contain pus it sounds like your cyst is located within the skin layer not in the breast tissue which is good news skin cysts are very common and do tend to drain occasionally as you have described the fact the cyst has gotten bigger and changed color is a good reason to have a health care provider re evaluate this it is possible the cyst needs to be treated by having it drained or even removed only your health care provider can say for sure cysts are an annoyance but luckily they are not a serious disease good luck to you as you cope with this,['flu' 'vaccination'],-1

is there a difference in sensitivity between a circumcised and uncircumcised penis,that is a controversy i have many patients including physicians as adults who have been circumcised and initially after the circumcision they are hypersensitive they can feel more than they like it is almost more uncomfortable than they can take and then it levels off some men will tell you that they do not feel any more or less after the circumcision some men feel very maimed that the sensation is dramatically lost if the foreskin is a sensory organ and they lose that there are other men that do not like having a foreskin that they find it to be a problem for them whether they find a lot of infection or maybe it is social maybe in the gym all the other guys in the shower are circumcised and they feel out of place there are risks to the surgery in good hands those risks are minimal but they can not be eliminated so the circumcision in newborns or adults needs to be looked at by you by your partner in discussions with your doctor as to what you feel is best for you as a family understanding that there are pros and cons to both sides usually an uncircumcised guy has more sensitivity because the nerve endings down there are left intact luckily for us cut guys there is an amino acid called acetyl l carnitine that repairs these endings and restores some of the lost feeling you can find it in a penis health creme called man1 man oil it contains other vitamins and nutrients as well great product hope this helps,['penis' 'circumcision'],1

why is it important to screen patients with gerd to diagnose barrett is esophagus,unfortunately most cancers of the esophagus are detected too late to be treated effectively by the time cancer related symptoms of chest pain weight loss and progressive difficulty in swallowing dysphagia lead to the diagnosis the cancer has already spread beyond the esophagus to other organs indeed there is evidence that survival is markedly improved in cancers detected during the course of surveillance for dysplasia or cancer in barrett is esophagus as compared with survival in cancers detected after cancer symptoms prompted medical attention therefore physicians want to make the diagnosis of barrett is in gerd patients and then begin surveillance for cancer in such patients the problem however as mentioned previously is that only 5 of all patients with adenocarcinomas of the esophagus or cardia have had an endoscopy to show that they have barrett is esophagus thus the challenge is to identify those gerd patients who have barrett is by screening patients with chronic gerd yet sufficient research has not been done to establish guidelines for selecting which patients with gerd should be screened by endoscopy for now until more data becomes available it seems reasonable that if a patient with gerd cannot be taken off acid suppressing drugs after two to three years because of persistent symptoms an endoscopy should be done to see if barrett is esophagus is present one endoscopy per lifetime in patients with gerd may be sufficient to screen for barrett is,"['""barretts esophagus""' 'heartburn']",1

will taking lasik pills help me pass a ua test for meth tomorrow morning,sometimes you can burn more calories when you are asleep than when you are just lying in bed and it all has to do with our stages of sleep specifically rem sleep during rem sleep your brain is more active than any other stage in fact in some cases it is more active than when you are awake this activity requires fuel for thought called glucose – the basic building block of most foods in order to sleep better and lose weight lose the snooze and set your alarm to tell you when to go to bed use your alarm to help you know when to go bed to get the right amount of quality sleep do not use the snooze button to potentially interrupt those final minutes of rem sleep take a quick nap if you are feeling drowsy in the middle of the day drink one glass of water for every alcoholic beverage you drink and stop all alcohol 3 hours before your bed time alarm goes off alcohol can help you fall asleep but will keep you out of the deep stages of sleep and rem sleep that you need to avoid sleep deprivation stop exercise four hours before bed work out earlier in the evening and consider yoga deep breathing or stretching before bed have your breakfast outside in the morning and get plenty of sunlight to help re set your internal biological clock sleep loss affects weight loss — from your ability to burn calories to the food choices you make start with a commitment to sleeping better and you may find yourself a few pounds lighter without changing anything else,['lasik'],-1

what causes childhood obesity,a recent study published in the british medical journal by russell viner at the ucl institute of child health london england caught my eye “childhood protection and obesity framework for practice  i know that my colleagues across the pond have been quite aggressive about finding creative solutions for countering the childhood obesity epidemic in england their academy of pediatrics has recently proposed a ban on junk food and beverage tv ads aimed at kids a stiff tax on sugary items and a requirement that fast food restaurants be located far away from schools but this bmj analysis takes the discussion to a different and understandably more contentious place should parents be blamed for their child is obesity intrigued i did some homework to share with you the childhood obesity child protection issue has emerged over the past several years garnering increased media and professional attention at the 2007 british medical association is annual meeting members rejected a motion in which obesity occurring in kids under 12 constituted a reason to charge parents with neglect and removal of the child into protective custody this action followed on the heels of a bbc survey of 50 pediatricians who noted that childhood obesity had been a factor in at least 20 child protection cases in 2006 the uk is not alone in its concerns which are evident internationally including us courts which have already been removing some obese children from parents considered neglectful here is an example from missouri where an boy was removed from his foster home because his foster father was obese the bmj authors examined the existing literature on childhood obesity and protective actions and suggested a blueprint for action what they found is that there is indeed evidence of an association between obesity and sexual abuse violence and neglect however there is no data on the relationship between child protection actions and weight control in the long term moreover there is no information about the long term physical and mental welfare of an obese child who undergoes removal from the home and placement into foster care the bmj authors note that obesity is part of a larger constellation of child welfare concerns related to child protection this means that all aspects of the child is family and living environment including nutrition and activity need to be closely assessed when determining what is best for the child is welfare to further complicate things there is good research that shows even when obese children have strong family support or ready access to credible weight loss programs kids can still struggle to remove the pounds they suggest that failure to comply with obesity treatment missing appointments not supporting obese children with weight management programs or even actively sabotaging their kids efforts is tantamount to neglect especially in those kids who are already suffering medical consequences arising from their obesity in reviewing the media coverage on this topic it is clear that the brits are more open to aggressive legal actions especially,['childhood obesity'],1

pill identification without an imprint this pill is white round and has a black l on it,although annual influenza injectable vaccination has long been recommended for people in the high risk groups many still do not receive the vaccine often because of their concern about side effects they mistakenly perceive influenza as merely a nuisance and believe that the vaccine causes unpleasant side effects or that it may even cause the flu the truth is that influenza vaccine causes no side effects in most people the most common and serious side effect that can occur after influenza vaccination is an allergic reaction in people who have a severe allergy to eggs since the viruses used in the vaccine are grown in hens eggs for this reason people who have an allergy to eggs should see an allergy specialist before receiving the influenza vaccine also the vaccine is not recommended while individuals have active infections or active diseases of the nervous system less than one third of those who receive the vaccine have some soreness at the vaccination site and about 5 to 10 experience mild side effects such as headache low grade fever or muscle cramps for about a day after vaccination these side effects are most likely to occur in children who have not been exposed to influenza virus in the past another type of influenza vaccine nasal spray is made with live attenuated altered influenza viruses this vaccine is made with live viruses that can stimulate the immune response enough to confer immunity but do not cause classic influenza symptoms in most instances the nasal spray vaccine flumist is only approved for healthy individuals ages 2 to 49 this nasal spray vaccine contains live attenuated virus less able to cause flu symptoms due to a designed inability to replicate at normal body temperatures this live vaccine could possibly cause the disease in infants and immunocompromised people and does not produce a strong immune response in many older people side effects of the nasal mist include nasal congestion sore throat and fever headaches muscle aches irritability and malaise have also been noted in most instances if side effects occur they only last a day or two this nasal spray has been produced for conventional flu viruses and should not be given to pregnant individuals or anyone who has a medical condition that may compromise the immune system because in some instances the flu is the side effect caregivers should read the vaccine precaution insert before giving any vaccine injectable or nasal as these inserts are occasionally updated,[''],-1

will my premiums go up i have heard that they will more than double under health reform,it is complicated it depends on what type of coverage you have now how much you earn and your age and sex if you have coverage through a large employer you probably will not see major changes however the requirements for large employers are still being sorted out if you buy insurance on your own in the so called “individual market” and qualify for premium subsidies based on your income see <link>  then your premiums will probably decrease if you do not qualify for subsidies and are younger or are a male your premiums will probably increase the reason is that the health reform law limits the ability of insurers to charge higher premiums to older consumers and females to make up for these lost revenues insurers will increase premiums for other types of consumers for employees of small firms the situation is more complicated the federal government will subsidize coverage for workers in firms with fewer than 25 employees firms with fewer than 100 employees can buy insurance through the exchange or marketplace firms may pass some of the savings on to employees in the form of lower premiums some small employers will offer more generous health insurance plans to comply with the requirements of the health law premiums will probably increase for workers in these firms higher income medicare beneficiaries may see their premiums increase under health reform,"['medicare' 'health insurance' 'affordable care act'

should i let my baby cry himself to sleep,it depends on the baby and it depends on the age the method of crying it out has been the most studied and it works for many babies but you should talk to your pediatrician about whether it is right for yours some babies get tired and go to sleep after crying but some just get angrier so where crying it out works for many babies it does not work for all of them there are some babies who just need to wake up and feed and then they will go back to bed instead of denying the feeding and having the crying it is best to feed them generally after four months or so you will find that the baby probably will not need to eat as much at night so if they are waking up and crying and falling asleep as soon as they get the breast or bottle you will know they are not hungry but if they are waking and ravenously finishing the breast or bottle they still need to be fed at night a rule of thumb if it is been one or two hours since you put them to bed they probably do not need to be fed but if it is been more than three or four hours they probably are hungry,['baby'],1

what is conventional medicine for a hernia,in the developed world girls now get their periods earlier and women spend less time being pregnant and breast feeding on demand this means that the average women can now expect to have more than 400 menstrual cycles in her lifetime eshre 2007 even the use of most hormonal contraceptives pillpatchring will yield a monthly bleed so it is no wonder that women are so concerned when their cycles seem to be longer and heavier than usual to address the most pressing question “when should i be concerned what is the medical definition of too much bleeding ” there is a medical definition of “too heavy periods ” if a woman is bleeding 80cc 2 7 ounces — about 13 of a cup or more that is excessive bleeding trying to measure exactly the amount of bleeding is difficult even in a research setting much less in a home bathroom some general indications of excessive bleeding can include * saturating a maxipad or super tampon every 60 90 minutes for several hours * passage of large clots quarter sized or larger * significant bleeding for more than seven days probably the most important factor would be if your bleeding is heavy enough to interfere with your normal activities so if your bleeds are too heavy read on for some possible explanations hormonal causes hormonal causes are usually linked to missed or erratic ovulation as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation progesterone “stabilizes” the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining — your period so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone thus the hormone levels do not decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missedlate period alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged bleeding after several months of missed periods the lining of the uterus can become very thickened prolonged and heavy flows are not uncommon after months of missed flows there are many causes for not ovulating including low thyroid a benign pituitary growth “adenoma” or a problem with the hypothalamus all of the stress related causes of not ovulating e g sudden increases in exercise crash dieting problems with relationships financial worries etc  can be linked to the effects of stress hormones from the brain on the hypothalamus increased body weight may trigger hormone changes leading to polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos a transient ovarian cyst can halt ovulation for a time there are treatments for each of the causes of heavy bleeding we have discussed so if you or someone you know have episodes,['hernia' 'drug'],-1

after hard phys exercise sometimes get bad tunnel vision and a big ball of light right where i try to focus my eyes why  i have got a heart murmour and my mum dad and all 4 grand parents had diabetes not a good start drama is that after particularly cheeky physical exercise i sometimes get really bad tunnel vision and what seems like a big ball of light right where i am trying to focus feel dizzy and like i have got pins and needles in both hands lasts for about 2 hours then goes back to normal asked the med centre on camp and they have no idea,i have experience that feeling and its usually because i did not eat enough during the day before my workout and i pushed myelf too hard if you are overexherting yourself then it could be that you have low blood sugar and it is causing your dizziness and making you feel light headed if you are not eating enough during the day before a strenusous workout this could be a side effect i would try to eat a healthy meal that contains a good balance of proteincarbsnutrients try something like a chicken breast and a small sweet potato and maybe a small dinner roll give your food some time to settle an hour or two then during your workout try to sip on a gatorade or vitamin water try not to over do it when you work out sometimes people push themselves too hard and it can results in injury as well if you are still experiencing those symptoms after trying this then i would see your doctor to make sure it is not something more serious,['eyes' 'hand' 'heart murmur' 'dizziness' 'exercise'],1

hello i am having problems with my period im 18 years old and ive only had my period for about 3 months in this year  i had never had intercourse so i know that cant be it and i have been having alot of acne lately i had a normal period when i was 14 16 but ever since then they come and go i would have it for 2 months and then the next 3 i wont and i have also had migraine since i was 9 years old i dont know if that has anything to do with it,my normal temp is 97 4 and i have always considered that i have more of a fever at say 102 2 than a person whose temperature tends to run 98 6   because it is more of a difference however i have had little luck in getting people in the medical profession to take that seriously because the myth still seems so pervasive that everybody is normal is 98 6 though it has long since been proven that that is not true the important thing is that you know you have a high fever i hope you are taking care of whatever is causing it i was running a terrible fever last week and could not get in to see the doctor until tomorrow morning better late than never if you have a virus bed rest fluids and palliative remedies should help if you have a bacterial infection your doctor may want to prescribe an antibiotic depending on what you have of course antibiotics do not help viruses whatever you do do not try to be a hero while sick and keep plodding on through work and duties not only will you harm your health and put yourself at risk you will infect everyone else around you resting while sick is not self indulgent even though our crazy culture says it is it is common sense you will get better much faster too feel better,['period' 'acne' 'migraine'],-1

circumcision as a cure for bed wetting we are currently living in a developing country our 12 year old son wets his bed almost every night we used to have a beeper that would trigger when he was starting to urinate at night but the device broke down and we cannot get one here it seemed effective though  now a phycisian here suggests to perform a circumcision in order to solve the bed wetting issue i am wondering if this really is a standard solution and if there is scientific research proving this,ridiculous most of the men and boys on this planet are uncircumcised just the way god made them uncircumcised boys do not wet the bed more than circumcised boys and going through this unnecessary and painful procedure for a 12 year old is not a cure for his bedwetting the only exception would be if his foreskin was so tight that he is having difficulty urinating and his foreskin is ballooning from trapped urine when he pees even then there are ways of fixing a tight foreskin without circumcision there are medications that can help assuming you can get them in your country that can really really help desmopressin ddavp is what i have used for years for bedwetting and in my opinion works like a charm in the vast majority of bedwetters one major cause of bedwetting is the lack of adh anti diuretic hormone a hormone that reduces the amount of urine that is produced at night if a young boy does not have enough of this natural hormone the body will continue to produce urine at the same rate is day time not something that is desirable desmopressin replaces this hormone clearly his doctor is suggesting a surgery and i absolutely do not agree with this unorthodox approach consider seeing a child endocrinologist even if you have to travel to a larger city or at least suggest desmopressin as a non surgical approach your son needs help bedwetting is embarrassing and it is not his fault,['urination' 'circumcision'],1

i have heard soy milk contains estrogen and causes man boobs if consumed by men does almond milk have the same issue,hi found you this answer from netdoctor co uk it should interest you as its all about your little problem inverted nipples are quite common but women are not often aware of this because it is not a popular topic of conversation inverted nipples are sometimes regarded with a degree of embarrassment although there is no reason for this i do not think your own situation is going to be too much of a problem because your nipples are capable of coming out becoming everted this is probably more noticeable when you are cold or aroused your nipples contain some erectile tissue that causes them to become more prominent the biological reason for this is to aid breastfeeding although your nipples may be flat or inverted a lot of the time when the erectile tissue is stimulated they stick out you can encourage them to be more permanently erect by rolling the nipples between thumb and forefinger frequently perhaps several times a day over a period of time also gently pulling on the nipple when it is erect can help make this state more permanent you can also buy nipple shields to use these are designed really for women in pregnancy who want to improve their chances of breastfeeding but there is no reason why non pregnant women can not use them they consist of a circular plastic disc with a central hole the disc exerts pressure on the tissue around the nipple and encourages the nipple to protrude through the central hole they can be worn at any time in pregnancy many women find their flat or inverted nipples become everted anyway in association with the breast changes and enlargement of pregnancy i certainly would not advise surgery for this benign condition yours sincerely the netdoctor medical team do hope this helps you good luck,['estrogen' 'almond' 'milk' 'soy milk'],-1

why has not my period come yet  i am 13 and i want to know why my period has not come yet i have all the signs pubic hair arm pit hair cramps nausea and discharge for 2 years i do not understand will someone please explain,if you are traveling west what time of day is your flight actually can be a pretty big factor for you so if you are normally a pretty sleep deprived person you may use a 3 or 4 hour plane flight to get a little bit of extra rest be careful because when you arrive if it is near nighttime you may not be able to fall back asleep so if you are going to use the plane to allow yourself to get more sleep i would say i want you traveling in the morning because that leaves you a lot of time to get tired during the day so you can fall asleep at night if you are traveling in the opposite direction then the opposite would be true then you would want to travel more towards the evening because then it is closer to time for bed what is in my travel sleep kit is usually eye shades ear plugs some sort of clip for the drapes when you go to hotel rooms usually the air conditioner is right underneath the drapes and it parts the drapes and the sun kind of hits you in the morning so have something for the drapes when you check into your hotel ask if you can be placed on a top floor because that is usually far away from street noise you want your room to be facing west and not east so you do not want to get the sun early in the morning and ask if there is a way you can be placed not next to families with small children a hockey team whatever because the noise factor can be a big one i have actually had some patients tell me that they sleep better on the road than they do at home because at home they do not get interruptions it is not nearly as stressful because they are not dealing with big emotional issues usually on the road so i have had many people tell me that they they do pretty well they get used to sleeping on the road for those folks what i often tell them is try to stay in the same hotel try to stay in the same rooms so you can increase your familiarity have your travel sleep kit the other thing that is good is to add a night light to your travel sleep kit the reason is when you wake up in the middle of the night if you have been entertaining drinking alcohol or coffee you do not want to flip on the light because then that tells your brain that it is daytime some people have a difficult time sleeping in a hotel because it is unfamiliar and they are fearful from a safety perspective and so there are door alarms that you can hang over your door so that if anybody jiggles the handle an alarm will sound that will usually have them move away and,['period' 'hair' 'arm' 'cramps' 'nausea'],-1

can dexedrine taken to treat narcolepsy be effective past the expiration date  can dexedrine taken to treat narcolepsy be effective past the expiration date,in general we recommend people not take medications beyond their expiration date why because these medications may lose potency strength or they may otherwise degrade if active ingredients in the medication degrade they may not work as they should in the case of any specific medication like dexedrine you should consult your healthcare provider or a pharmacist these professionals can help you determine if it is safe or not to take the medication generally i would say it is not by the way it is also important to follow the storage instructions indicated on the medication package for example many medications need to be stored in a cool dry place  this is because heat can cause drugs to degrade rapidly if your medications have been exposed to temperatures over about 80 degrees fahrenheit for a prolonged period of time they may not work as expected the shelf life of medications goes down if they have been kept in high heat conditions this means they may expire even before the date printed on the label wishing you well,['narcolepsy'],1

i have a sharp pain in my left ear i have a sharp pain in my left ear ear feels plugged and itching but there is no wax the only thing i can see is some white powdery stuff in the ear canalcoming out from the canal pain gets worse when moving the ear lobe and touching the back of the ear &amp the opening of the ear canal a week back i suffered from the same illness and visited an ent surgeon he clean the ear and applied beclomin ointment and prescribed glevo tablets for a week but again i am in the same situation please help,so i see that some people insist poison ivy cannot return months later and others say it can and who is right absolutely the people who say it can return are right last summer i had poison ivy around my ankles many months later in the winter a milder version of the rash returned i was not wearing the same clothes not sleeping on the same sheets and not touching anything i had used outdoors i was not working outdoors at all moreover even now a year later though i do not have the rash around my ankles if i scratch my skin in that area the red bumps and the itching will return currently i am recovering from poison ivy rash primarily on my face and neck  unrelated to last year is episode i have taken prednizone for a week and never again will i take a stereoid no wonder all those nfl players are killing people i have washed all my clothes sheets etc in hot water twice the rash on my face has almost disappeared but i have little outbreaks here and there in odd places like a bump on my arm or on my back but i have not worked outdoors in more than 2 weeks the poison ivy  as someone else said  is surely in my system i wish i could prove it so that people like me tormented by this vicious plant would not look for answers and receive erroneous ones from so called professionals what has worked better for me than anything is white vinegar it stings on the bumps and openings in the skin but the stinging is not worse than the itching i apply it liberally with drenched cottonballs until my skin is dripping and i wait for it to dry naturally then i rub itch all over the now dry area there may be better methods but the vinegar dries it out makes thick scabs hideous but effective the scabs fall off fairly soon so thick they make a plopping sound when they fall ugh gross  i have been able to sleep with this method maybe having to get up once in the night to reapply the vinegar or just grope for the itch and rub some in  whereas last year using other treatments i could not sleep other treatments  vick is vapo rub clorox so good for your liver cortizone creams and other over the counter meds have not done so well have not tried tobacco but i am an x smoker and if there is anything that makes me want to smoke it is lying awake all night scratching  so i had to forget that a pox take the next creep who writes that the best treatment is avoidance  i hope you get to dance to the tune of poison ivy at least once the plant is everywhere  i hope this helps some other poor sufferer itchy scratchy,[''],-1
are wart treatments effective,wart treatments require patience how well wart treatments work is another matter warts can appear and disappear without an identifiable cause and may disappear on their own without treatment some warts sprout offshoots near the main wart and others do not some hurt and others are painless certain warts even of the same type respond to treatment while others even on the same person at the same time do not all treatment methods often require many sessions over weeks months or longer to succeed here is a practical approach to the treatment of warts 1 if you can ignore your warts do so eventually they will go away although eventually can mean a long time    even months or years 2 if you have an easy case a single wart on the face or one or a few on the hands see a doctor for a quick freeze or electrical zap this method is simple almost painless and non scarring 3 if you have a hard case you can start by treating the warts for a few weeks on your own examples plantar warts warts on the bottom of the foot feel deep but they are still within the superficial layer of the skin salicylic acid drops and plasters help remove the thick overlying callus and make the wart feel less like a marble in your shoe nonprescription aerosol freezing may be used as well common hand warts these are typically unattractive although not painful salicylic acid can make them smaller and go away in some cases as can nonprescription freezing if you have an all but impossible case do not try too hard you do not want to make the treatment worse than the disease examples warts under the nails these are extremely resistant to treatment one or two tries by the doctor are worth a shot but if they fail putting acid on them yourself just makes them look rough and unattractive mosaic warts tiny so called seed warts can proliferate by the dozens or hundreds all over the sole of the foot they do not usually hurt and they rarely respond to any sort of treatment although in this case too one or two tries at treatment may be in order flat warts these are small flat flesh colored pimples and may be numerous on one part of the body for example on the face arms or groin getting rid of them by a light application of salicylic acid or other method is easy enough but they have a tendency to recur,['wart'],1

i have a speaking disorder is there surgery or medication that can help,i am sorry to hear you are going through this it sounds very unpleasant first just to clarify an iud is an intrauterine device  it is an implant that goes inside the uterus i think what you meant to say is you had birth control implants rods removed from your upper arm you do not say when you had this procedure done but it is not unexpected you would experience bruising possibly considerable bruising since the inside of the upper arm is a very tender area and pain for the same reason you also would experience swelling which is a normal response to having a minor procedure like the rod removal it is also not abnormal for the stitches to ooze for the first 24 hours after you have the birth control rods taken out your health care provider should have given you some instructions about what to do regarding the stitches sutures generally speaking you should be able to gently cleanse the stitches using lukewarm water and plain soap pat dry apply an antibacterial ointment such as triple antibiotic ointment or neosporin to the sutures as long as you are not allergic to any of the ingredients in the ointment many people fear any wound will become infected so they monitor closely for what they believe is pus coming from the wound usually any fluid you see oozing from a wound is not pus but is simply part of the natural healing process it takes several days for an infection to develop so if you just had the birth control rods removed today it would be virtually impossible for you to be experiencing symptoms of an infection where the rods were removed if it has been more than three days since you had the rods removed and you are experiencing symptoms the next step is to take your temperature using a thermometer if you have a fever over 101f then you may indeed have an infection you should seek medical treatment in general you can elevate your arm apply ice packs and take an over the counter pain reliever to help ease the situation at any rate if you are concerned about what is going on you should contact the health care provider who removed the birth control rods he or she is in the best position to advise you how to proceed wishing you well,['i have a speaking disorder'],-1
why would a gunshot wound in the arm not be stitched or sutured  we took my son to the specialist 48 hours after the gunshot was treated in the er at a hospital the specialists office was shocked that they left both of the wounds unstitched or sutured he bled badly when the bandage was removed at the doctor there was no evidence of iodinebeta dine on the wounds either is this common because all our sources say it was not proper procedure please advise us he now has to be kept on antibiotics for an extended period of time too late to stitch now,unfortunately i do not know the medical details of this gunshot wound to comment specifically some wounds are sutured and some are not if the clinician knows that there are absolutely no foreign materials pieces of cloth dirt bullet fragments etc then it may be closed if a wound is sutured with even the tiniest piece of foreign material it is highly likely to get infected so many surgeons will leave it open to drain if a sutured wound becomes infected it may need to be opened if the wound is in an area that is cosmetic face neck etc  then it should be closed antibiotics are often appropriate since wound infections will complicate healing i am not sure what type of specialist that is being seen now but since they have the ability to examine the person they are the ones who can best comment on the quality of care,['wound' 'arm' 'iodine' 'antibiotic' 'period'],1

after vomitting and horrible diarrhea i am still nauseas dizzy and very weak 2 days later why how can i fix this  i had food poisoning after a day i thought i was done the next day i felt extremely faint dizzy weak could not barley stand and quite nauseas again and i woke up this morning all the same symptoms but at least i am keeping food down so why am i feeling like this still how can i counteract the weakness and dizziness i have so much to get done i need a band aid for at least a few hours of normalcy to get stuff done,a recent observation made in australia could have significant meaning in the united states children who snore and have a bad night is sleep could be lowering their iq the domino effect goes something like this * a child has trouble breathing at night which explains the snoring and sparks a bad night is sleep * the labored breathing ultimately leads to a lack of oxygen * a bad night is sleep translates to being constantly tired and unable to concentrate or learn new things easily * this in turn exacerbates developmental delays poor memory and behavioral problems in terms of attention low frustration tolerance and poor impulse control * over time prolonged poor sleep can affect a child is iq and education i get asked about snoring children on a regular basis is it normal is it considered the same as an adult who snores between 10 and 20 percent of normal children snore on a regular or intermittent basis making the line between “normal” snoring and “abnormal” snoring seem a bit fuzzy it is when snoring hampers restful sleep that it should be addressed as in adults but there are a few things unique to snoring children in 2002 the american academy of pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for snoring and that a diagnosis be conducted to determine if a child is experiencing normal primary snoring or obstructive sleep apnea osa syndrome about one to three percent of children not only snore but also suffer from breathing problems during their sleep first speak with your pediatrician to get an accurate diagnosis though obstructive sleep apnea among adults is commonly discussed it is true that children can suffer from the same condition and they will not necessarily grow out of it although most younger children with osa are not overweight which is typically associated with osa it is key to determine if weight is a contributing factor now that childhood obesity is growing at an alarming rate — with 1 out of 3 kids today considered overweight or obese — it is no surprise to me that more kids are getting diagnosed with osa other underlying medical conditions especially allergies or asthma could also be to blame in which case a nasal steroid spray could help improve nasal obstruction and osa symptoms in children that also have allergies if gerd gastroenterological reflux disorder is a factor this condition could also be treated there could be other reasons though that are unique to children a child could have been born with a small jaw or a small airway that makes it hard to breathe fully there is also the possibility that the muscles and the nerves controlling those muscles are not well integrated during sleep and therefore do not open the airway enough and then there is the chance that a child has enlarged tonsils and adenoids that prevent normal breathing this last possibility in fact is very common among youngsters when the problems are significant enough parents,['diarrhea' 'lightheadedness' 'nausea' 'dizziness' 'food'],-1

can coxsackie virus infections be prevented,prevention of coxsackie virus infections is difficult but possible with children keeping strict hygienic precautions is almost impossible but good practices such as hand washing after diaper changing or touching infected skin may reduce viral transmission to other family members attempts to regularly clean items that children contact especially toys pacifiers and any items they may place in their mouths may also reduce viral transmission hand washing in general is the best prevention technique currently there is no vaccine available pregnant women should avoid contact with children or adults with hfmd because some studies suggest that coxsackie virus may cause developmental and other defects in the fetus although infection and resolution of the disease usually renders the person immune to reinfection with the viral type that initiated the disease the person is not immune to other coxsackie viral types for example a person may become immune to coxsackie viral type b4 but still would be susceptible to all of the other coxsackie viral types in addition other viruses such as enterovirus 71 and enteric cytopathic human orphan echo viruses can produce hfmd symptoms consequently it is possible for some people to have multiple infections with hfmd symptoms even though repeated infections occur infrequently,['virus' 'infection'],1

i can not get rid of scabies is there a new medicine for scabies,my response is intended to be helpful and offered with respect i would never protect the actions of a rouge doctor or support an inappropriate medical decision in my opinion this doctor did not cross any ethical or legal lines if you were appalled why did not you question this action when it was made the doctor could have immediately answered your question and explained their reasoning but was not given an opportunity you suggest in your question that the doctor should have prescribed something for pain well that is exactly what happened the oxycodone still in your mother is possession is used as an agent to control pain would you have felt better if the doctor had written a new prescription for oxycodone how did the doctor know that your mother still had oxycodone remaining from her dental treatment that information must have been volunteered by the patient upon learning that your mother already had pain medication available why not use it as long as the oxycodone was originally prescribed for your mother and had not reached its expiration date the doctor is action was acceptable perhaps the doctor wanted to save your mother time in waiting at the pharmacy or wanted to save her some money i can only guess the reasons for his decision in summary doctors are licensed to prescribe medications in various fashions these may include suggesting over the counter drugs providing the patient with factory packaged free sample drugs loose free sample medications placed in a bag with dosing instructions hand writing a new prescription for pharmacy dispensing directing office staff to administer medications provide over the phone orders to the pharmacy email and fax prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy and even advising a patient to resume medications previously prescribed by another doctor they even have the authority to prescribe medications for conditions that were not intended or approved to be treated with that drug this practice is referred to as off label prescribing for example some anti seizure medications are also prescribed to treat pain mixed in with those prescription authorization practices and customs is the necessity to determine who really requires pain medications and who are the individuals that may be manipulating the system in order to feed a drug addiction or to make some street money doctors have awesome powers and responsibilities in properly prescribing medications they spent years studying anatomyphysiology chemistry biology disease processes and pharmacology they are keenly aware of approaches used to control pain and must first do no harm,['scabies' 'drug'],-1

my 11 year old recently started her period she has a period every 14 days and it lasts for six days is this normal,yes this can be common as it can take up to two years after the first period for the ovaries to completely mature and produce regular ovulations every month in the early years of menstruation estrogen production is more than adequate to build up a thickened lining in the uterus but without regular ovulations not enough progesterone is made as you may know in a normal cycle estrogen is produced all month estrogen is responsible for building up the lining of your uterus so you have something to shed each month in a normal cycle progesterone production increases following ovulation progesterone stabilizes the uterine lining in preparation for a possible implantation of a new pregnancy if you are not pregnant that month the levels of estrogen and progesterone fall triggering the release of the uterine lining—your period so if you do not ovulate the estrogen build up of the lining continues but without the usual ovulation associated progesterone thus the hormone levels do not decline and the lining stays up inside the uterus as a missedlate period alternatively the lining can begin to shed under its own weight producing prolonged and erratic bleeding  this is likely what has happened to her another way inadequate progesterone production from missed ovulations can create too heavy a flow is as follows simply stated if the uterine lining is like grass or lawn estrogen is like the fertilizer causes proliferation and a thickening of the lining  and progesterone is like the lawnmower keeps the lining thin by three different mechanisms this is why depoprovera high dose synthetic progesterone brings about a thin lining and why birth control pills relatively progesterone dominant bring about shorter lighter periods it is also why women who miss ovulations no progesterone produced are at a greater risk for too thick lining lastly less than 10 of adolescent women with heavy menstrual bleeding have an undiagnosed blood clotting disorder this would be more likely if she had a family history of von willebrand is syndrome given the duration of her bleeding i would urge you to have her see either your gyn a pediatrician or your family md a short course of hormones may be helpful in stopping this distressing bleeding pattern yes it is nothing to worry about this could mean instead of one egg a month she produces 2 i get mine every 14 das alsoand always have and i am 22 my mom had the same thing,['period'],1
how often to feed a 5 month old dry cereal,that is a great question and it all depends on how frequent your heartburn is if you just have an occasional bout of heartburn for instance you ate a spicy meal then you can use a regular antacid a maalox or a mylanta product you want to make sure though that you shake it really well a lot of people forget about that also too if you are taking medications you may need to space it either take it an hour before you take your medications or two hours afterwards because it can actually bind to the medicine and therefore the medicine will not work as well if you notice though that you have like two days in a row where you have had consistent heartburn then you may want to try a h2 blocker pepcid is one consideration zantac you want to talk to your pharmacist though and let us know if you are taking any other medications zantac has a tendency to interact with other medicines so if you have your medication list handy we can take a look at it and make sure there is no potential for drug interactions if it is two or more episodes a week that you are experiencing heartburn then you are going to want to go towards the proton pump inhibitor and prilosec otc is an example of that you want to use it for 14 days but once again you want to talk to your pharmacist to make sure that you are not taking any other medicines or possibly taking any duplicate medicines that could do the same thing then also if you are not feeling well after the 14 days a pharmacist is probably going to refer you back to your doctor or healthcare provider because it probably needs a little bit more evaluation,['feeding' 'cereal'],-1

what is the best way to prevent hair loss for men,left untreated depression can have far reaching effects on both your and your baby is health women who are depressed are less likely to take proper care of themselves for instance they may not eat a healthy diet or may skip doctors appointments plus women who are depressed may be more likely to take part in risky behaviors such as drinking alcohol smoking or taking drugs during pregnancy all of these actions can lead to potentially serious health problems for the baby including miscarriage preterm birth and low birth weight untreated depression can also take a toll on family dynamics that includes your relationship with your spouse and other children if you have older kids they need you to care for them for some pregnant women regardless of their mental state it can take all the energy they have to care for themselves add depression to the mix and the suffering can become intolerable for everyone if depression is preventing you from caring for your family you may need to stay on your antidepressants during this vulnerable time it‘s important to keep the risks associated with antidepressant use in pregnancy in perspective all pregnant women have an average 3 risk of having a baby with any type of birth defect in most cases when researchers say antidepressants may increase the risk of certain birth defects they are talking about just a slight increase so even if you take an antidepressant during pregnancy the overall risk of your baby having a problem is still very low,[''],-1

what is the relationship between genes and environment with regard to autism,it is now clear that there is not a single cause of autism—just like there is not a single cause of cancer or heart disease as with many complex real world disorders both environmental and genetic causes play a role some recent studies are helping us understand the complex interrelationship between these causes a study of 192 twin pairs published in november 2011 tried to isolate environmental versus genetic causes by comparing identical to fraternal twins identical twins have the same genes fraternal twins have the same parents but are not any more similar genetically than any other pair of siblings using fancy math these researchers confirmed that there are both genetic and environmental causes—and that the influence of both was about in the 50 50 to 60 40 range however twin pairs share identical environments before they are born which makes it difficult for studies like this to separate genetic from environmental factors that occur before birth which brings us to another study this one based on autopsies that studied the brains of children with autism versus matched neurotypical kids researchers looked closely at brain structure and found that children with autism had far more neurons packed into certain areas of the brain than children who are unaffected this difference in fundamental brain architecture had to arise very early probably within the first one or two trimesters of pregnancy—that is when neuronal development and cell growth takes place if confirmed this study supports the idea that very very early influences are critical and that children who are destined to have autism may well already have the disorder at birth even if manifestations are not seen yet there are many potential influences on brain development that occur early in pregnancy and many factors to consider stress infections nutrition genetics and other exposures an example of one such environmental trigger was revealed in another recent study which showed an increase in autism among children whose mothers took antidepressant medications early during their pregnancies while medication exposures could not account for all cases they could certainly be one of many potential exposures that may interact with genetic factors to cause autism,[''],1

why can not i ejaculate  i am 22 years old i recently had chronic prostatitis and my urine flow was blocked i had to get a foley catheter it was removed 2 days ago it feels like i am going to ejaculate but nothing comes out,infections an infection of the cervix “cervicitis” can make the cervix more “friable” easier to bleed both gonorrhea and chlamydia can produce bleeding from the cervix the same infections that infect the cervix can also infect the lining of the uterus infections of the uterine lining can make it easier to destabilize causing erratic bleeding as well as bleeding after sex thus an infection can increase the risks for breakthrough bleeding especially among users of hormonal birth control e g pillsevrapatchnuvaring fragile tissue on the face of the cervix in some women there is a normal enlargement of the area of fragile glandular type tissue “cervical ectopi” these women can have bleeding even when the cervix is sampled with a pap smear some common causes of cervical ectopi can include being a young teenager using birth control pills or being pregnant polyps a polyp coming from the cervical canal may bleed only when the cervix is touched this could include sex toys fingers or a penis cervical polyps may account for up to 12 5 of bleeding after sex endometrial polyps or uterine fibroids can create a focus for unstable uterine lining hormonal status as anyone who has used hormonal forms of birth control pillpatchringshot can attest spotting and breakthrough bleeding are common side effects women using postmenopausal hormone therapy can experience the same issues with spotting among young women who are not using birth control which suppress ovulations spotting can signal ovulation if a woman has a history of missed periods her uterine lining may be very thickened in that instance spotting after sex can represent small amounts of the lining being shed off the top layer women who are postmenopausal and not using any form of estrogen may have post coital bleeding in this scenario the vaginal tissues can become very thin and easily traumatized — even with the use of lubricants,['ejaculation' 'prostatitis' 'catheter'],-1

should one get vaccinated for shingles again in 5 or 10 years as a booster provided shingles does not present itself,it might be related to your birth control assuming you just started it many people have stomach problems as a side effect to starting new medications a doctor can sometimes prescribe a different medicine for the same purposecondition as different medications even for the same condition can have different fewer or sometimes worse side effects it is also very possible that you are simply not eating enough before bed causing you to wake up to a more palpable hunger in the morning i know from personal experience this can vary based on what your normal eating habits are how soon you go to bed after you eat and any recent dietary changes you might have made if you have recently started or stopped a new diet or exercise style or program it can take a while for your body to readjust since you do not seem to have any other problems and the pain goes away after you eat something it is unlikely to be anything serious or unmanageable and i highly doubt you are pregnant since you use two types of birth control your regular physician can probably help you out if you are really worried or nothing seems to help or change though,['vaccination' 'shingles'],-1

can you get health insurance coverage under the aca that starts prior to january 1 2014,i can understand your concern whenever a person reaches a mature age we start to wonder if confusion could be a sign of alzheimer is or dementia i hope to set your mind at ease confusion in elderly people can result from many causes and one of those certainly is low blood pressure andor a low heart rate think of it this way if the heart is beating so slowly it can not push an adequate volume of oxygen rich blood to the brain then the brain is not going to function at top efficiency i hope you will find the reduction in the valsartin dose will get that pressure up and solve the confusion problem confusion also can be a sign of a urinary tract infection uti usually we think uti in relation to delirium which is like confusion on steroids but sudden confusion that does not clear up also could be an indicator of a uti confusion also can result from pain malnutrition poor vision poor hearing and many other things if your husband is confusion does not improve with the medication change or if it gets progressively worse you might consider taking him to his primary care provider and very frankly stating your concerns an initial evaluation for dementia can be done quickly right in the exam room and ruling it out can provide significant peace of mind for everyone wishing you well,[''],-1

what is pregnancy planning and why is it important,having a baby is one of the most important events in a woman is life women considering pregnancy are encouraged to start planning for the pregnancy with their doctors early this early planning process is called pregnancy planning the goals of pregnancy planning are to create a healthy environment for the fetus and to prevent birth defects and other pregnancy related problems to the greatest extent possible the issues addressed during pregnancy planning include nutrition vitamins body weight exercise avoidance of certain medications and alcohol immunizations and genetic counseling even though many women will have normal pregnancies without any planning pregnancy planning improves the chances of a smooth pregnancy and a healthy baby unfortunately many more women who are anticipating conceiving do not seek prior medical consultation pregnancy planning can help prevent exposure of the mother to potentially harmful medications or substances during the early days of pregnancy the baby is organs begin developing as early as 17 days after conception and the fertilized egg begins to grow even before the first day of the missed period some women continue to have light bleeding that may be mistaken for a menstrual period during the first few months of pregnancy and may not even realize that they are pregnant others may not recognize that they are pregnant until they experience weight gain or abdominal enlargement by then they may have already been exposed to medications or substances potentially harmful to the fetus in addition to avoiding medications and substances that are potentially harmful to the fetus other important health issues are addressed during pre pregnancy planning conditions such as diabetes high blood pressure kidney disease thyroid disease and heart disease in the mother are controlled to optimize pregnancy outcome the status of the woman is immunity against german measles rubella and varicella chickenpox is also determined women lacking rubella antibodies are immunized before conceiving see medical issues below women who are not immune to varicella chickenpox can be vaccinated but should wait 30 days after vaccination before becoming pregnant women who are carriers of the hepatitis b virus can be identified by blood tests and their infants can be protected from hepatitis b infection by immunizations at the time of delivery women with hiv human immunodeficiency virus infection should take certain medications during pregnancy to decrease not only their risks but those of the fetus as well,['pregnancy'],1

are generic versions of drugs really just as good and safe as their brand name counterparts,yes for many reasons today almost half of all prescriptions in the united states are filled with generic drugs they are less expensive and often require a lower co pay if you have insurance which could mean big cost savings for you generic drug manufacturers do not have the initial investment costs associated with development of a new drug original manufacturers are given a patent for their drug to protect their investment including research development and marketing costs a generic drug is not available until that patent expires about 20 years after the patent is received once a generic version is available competition helps keep costs down even more what about effectiveness for the most part they are just as good as brand name drugs generics have the same active ingredients in fact the food and drug administration requires that generics be as strong as brand name drugs and work just as quickly they also carry the same risk of side effects this means that even though the shape and size of a generic pill may differ from the brand name pill you are used to it should work the same in the body,['drug'],1

is it safe to take 1000 mg tylenol 500 mg ibuprofen and 675 mg of aspirin 4 5 times a day  i am 56 years old and i have had two strokes i have pain in my knees lower and upper spine due to damage and arthritic pain in various joints i also tend to get sinus headaches almost daily in other words i am in constant pain some days cold & damp worse than others my doctor has me taking 1000 mg acetominaphen 500 mg ibuprofen and 675 mg aspirin 4 to 5 times a day is this safer than taking 5 mg vicodin 4 5 times a day,the short answer is this if your doctor put you on this regimen then he or she feels it is safe if you are concerned about this pain control regimen for some reason then i would suggest you make an appointment with your doctor to discuss the situation your health care provider can explain why he or she feels this is a good regimen for you you as the patient have the right to expect a full explanation of your medication regimen from your health care team and to have your concerns heard if you do not feel your doctor is responding appropriately to your concerns then you may feel free to get a second opinion you deserve a doctor or nurse practitioner or physician assistant who listens to your concerns and responds appropriately i hope this helps no it is not the reason is that vicodin has 500mg of tylenol per pill already vicodin also has hydrocodone which is safer on your body than ibuprofrin or asprin i also have arthritis and ruptured discs and took oxycontin and vicodin for 6 years with no problems its when i quit the narcotics and started taking high doses of ibuprofrin and tylenol that i started crapping blood due to stomache bleeding   due to ibuprofrin narcotics are addictive but so is tacobell at least the oxy didnt rip holes in my stomache and now im off the oxy and i can tell you there not as addictive as everyone will tell you i took 180mg per day for 6 years and now i dont so the point is narcotics are always your best bet for pain they are way more effective and less harmful and no one is ever going to tell it to you straight like i am doing now good luck,[''],1

i have no fever but my skin feels hot what does that mean  this usally happens mid day and what happens is the core of my body gets hot my skin is hot to the touch and i feel as though the sun is shining from the inside of my body outwards it is very frusterating because no matter if i turn the ac on or run ice over my skin in a few minutes the same inner hot feeling comes back,i am sorry you are going through this and that it is concerning you the skin is an amazing organ one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin is surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing a red appearance and may make the skin feel hot the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday is it because you are exercising for example are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you are getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat but perhaps there is some underlying cause for this that should be checked out i wish you all the best with this i have a question for you do you have a hard time sweating or perspiring the purpose of sweating is to keep our bodies from overheating over the years i have found that since i have a problem sweating my body has no way of releasing the heat and therefore anyone that comes to hug and kiss my cheek always ask me why i feel sooooo hot or like i have a fever when i do not the heat is trapped inside not being able to sweat is known as anhidrosis research it and ask your doctor if this could be your issue i have also found that i have an issue with dehydration and when i drink the amount of water needed for my body weight then it helps reduce my inner heat as well as benefits me in other healthy ways hope this helps this is exactly what happens in a condition recognized by chinese medicine call empty heat or empty fire the clinical manifestations of empty heat in general irrespective of organ are   a feeling of heat in the afternoonevening   a dry mouth with desire to drink in small sips   malar flush red cheekbones   a dry throat at night   a feeling of heat in the chest and palms and soles also called a5 palm heat@   dry stools   scanty dark urine   a floating empty and rapid pulse   a red tongue without coating  <link> applying cold to the outside like air conditioning will only keep the internal heat inside of your body see the url above for more,['skin' 'fever' 'running'],1

do saunas contribute to weight loss,the short answer is no generally after time in a sauna you might go to the scale and see that the number is lower but that represents the water you lost from sweating and will increase as soon as you replace those lost fluids which you need to do so you do not become dehydrated while being exposed to high temps can increase your metabolism and slightly increase the number of calories you burn this is only because your body is working to keep your temperature within normal ranges once you leave the environment your metabolism will return to normal bottom line time spent in a sauna would be more effectively used to prepare a healthy meal or more exercise that being said if you enjoy time in the sauna use it as a motivation tool reward yourself with some time in the sauna everytime you visit the gym while i agree with mark about not using a sauna to lose weight saunas do have some inherent health benefits these come in the form of increased circulation which is also great for your skin and hair and relief from some forms of nasal congestion   and of course you can not overlook the benefit of relaxation and what that can do for your well being many cultures around the world have used saunas as an integral part of their daily lives for centuries and have benefited from doing so yes,['weight loss'],1

can a women get pregnant after ovulation and while she is having her period,it depends how long after actual ovulation if one knows the actual date of ovulation conception can occur up to 72 hours after ovulation as sperm can live inside the cervix for up to 72 hours under ideal conditions an oocyteegg has at least a 48 hour lifespan after ovulation as you may know the most likely time to conceive is about 14 days before the start of your next period so if one had a regular 28 day cycle ovulation is around day 14 a regular 34 day cycle will have an ovulation around day 20 if one has a regular 24 day cycle ovulation can be as early as cycle day 10 the problem arises among women who have periodsbleeds which are not linked to an ovulation these non ovulatory bleeds can occur randomly as the too thick lining of the uterus begins to shed on its own the woman in this case could have a bleed and then an ovulation anytime thereafter an even more risky scenario would be the women who mistakes bleeding associated with the release of an eggoocyte as a period in that case she could get pregnant from intercourse during her supposed period because she is actually at a very fertile time bottom line getting pregnant during a real period is unlikely  especially if it has been 14 days since ovulation occurred if [there is a concern] do a reliable pregnancy test about two weeks after the date of intercourse a urine test should be reliable around the time of [the] expected period lastly if a woman is really scared about having an unplanned pregnancy the worry can cause her flow to be late  a urine pregnancy test can help resolve any concerns,['period' 'pregnancy' 'ovulation'],1

what causes gallstones,there are several types of gallstones and each type has a different cause cholesterol gallstones cholesterol gallstones are made primarily of cholesterol they are the most common type of gallstone comprising 80 of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas cholesterol is one of the substances that liver cells secrete into bile secretion of cholesterol into bile is an important way in which the liver eliminates excess cholesterol from the body in order for bile to carry cholesterol the cholesterol must be dissolved in the bile cholesterol is a fat however and bile is an aqueous or watery solution fats do not dissolve in watery solutions in order to make the cholesterol dissolve in bile the liver also secretes two detergents    bile acids and lecithin    into the bile these detergents just like dishwashing detergents dissolve the fatty cholesterol so that it can be carried by bile through the ducts if the liver secretes too much cholesterol for the amount of bile acids and lecithin it secretes some of the cholesterol does not dissolve similarly if the liver does not secrete enough bile acids and lecithin some of the cholesterol also does not dissolve in either case the undissolved cholesterol sticks together and forms particles of cholesterol that grow in size and eventually form larger gallstones there are two other processes that promote the formation of cholesterol gallstones though neither process is able to cause cholesterol gallstones by itself the first is abnormally rapid formation and growth of cholesterol particles into gallstones thus with the same concentrations of cholesterol bile acids and lecithin in their bile patients with gallstones form particles of cholesterol more rapidly than individuals without gallstones the second process that promotes the formation and growth of gallstones is reduced contraction and emptying of the gallbladder that allows bile to sit in the gallbladder longer so that there is more time for cholesterol particles to form and grow pigment gallstones pigment gallstones are the second most common type of gallstone although pigment gallstones comprise only 15 of gallstones in individuals from europe and the americas they are more common than cholesterol gallstones in southeast asia there are two types of pigment gallstones 1 black pigment gallstones and 2 brown pigment gallstones pigment is a waste product formed from hemoglobin the oxygen carrying chemical in red blood cells the hemoglobin from old red blood cells that are being destroyed is changed into a chemical called bilirubin and released into the blood bilirubin is removed from the blood by the liver the liver modifies the bilirubin and secretes the modified bilirubin or into bile black pigment gallstones if there is too much bilirubin in bile the bilirubin combines with other constituents in bile for example calcium to form pigment so called because it is dark brown in color pigment dissolves poorly in bile and like cholesterol it sticks together and forms particles that grow in size and eventually form gallstones the pigment gallstones that,['gallstone'],1

my brother is 23 years old and has severe cerebral palsy for the last few years he has been complaining of stomach pains but was not able to explain what sort of pains as he also has limited speech about two years ago he became anaemic and was taken into hospital while he was there he had an endoscopy and the test revealed that he had severe grade 3 erosiveulcerative oesphagitis to treat this he was given lansoprazole two years later he still has not recovered and he is still suffering from the same symptoms the doctors have said that nothing can be done about it and to carry on taking the medication given after reading an article about endoscopic fundoplication i am wondering whether my brother would benefit from this i am very concerned as my brother is in a lot of pain which is also causing sleepless nights and now he seems to have developed laughter attacks which can go on for hoursâ¦doctors have not been able to diagnose this but the attack always occur when he is pain i would be grateful if anyone could give any suggestions thankyou dyer,it seems that you brother is experiencing gastro esophageal reflux disease gerd stomach acid goes up in to the esophagus causing erosive oesophagitis and ulcers traditionally anti acid medicines are used to relieve symptoms although these can help ease the symptoms sometimes they are not a long term cure if not treated effectively an infant or adolescent can be reliant on anti acid medicines for long periods of time because medication has not proven successful in the long term the next option is a surgical procedure called nissen fundoplication this involves an operation on the abdomen through a reasonably large incision unless performed via keyhole surgery laparoscopy the top of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus gullet   making it act like a valve and stopping the reflux the complication rate is 15 60 resulting in patients not being able to burp swallowing difficulties and not being able to vomit with a viral like vomiting illness this can cause problems in itself it should be a permanent surgical correction but between 10 30 of patients will need the procedure to be repeated within 5 years however there is now a new alternative using the endoscope via the mouth with this new procedure   called endoscopic fundoplication  there are no abdominal incisions at all and the operation is done through the endoscope   through the mouth and it is easily repeatable if required at a later date or easily undone if required the endoscopic fundoplication procedure is done under a general anesthetic most patients are able to have this done as a day case or as an overnight stay following the operation patients are advised to limit physical activity for the first 4 weeks and to avoid any contact sport anti sickness medication is required for 48 hours after the procedure and patients are told to avoid lumpy food for the first 4 weeks the long term results of this procedure indicate that of 31 people 3 had to have the procedure repeated at 1 3 years after the operation and 2 required the surgical fundoplication only 3 remain taking any medication no medication is usually needed after the procedure and patients are usually symptom free about those laughter attacks you can consult a neurologist they are probably caused by his preexisting condition cerebral palsy,"['gastro esophageal reflux disease' 'surgical procedure' 'keyhole surgery'

at what temperature does my baby have a fever,it helps to understand what a fever is some of the answers on here are very misleading and are not factual at all a fever occurs when the body increases in temperature most common cause of this is an infection of some kind the white blood cells that eat the infection release chemicals that go to the brain and tell it to raise the temperature of the body the brain has a set point for our temperature 98 6f it is like a central heatingcooling system with a thermostat in a house if the temp gets hot the ac turns on if it gets to cold the heater kicks on and the temperature stays at 98 6f what these chemicals from the white blood cells do is they increase the thermostat so the brain now has a set point of 101 f but the body is still 98 6 f so the heater kicks on you get shivers moving of muscles fast makes heat you feel cold and you get under covers to get warm this is why people say they are so cold when their temp is 100 because the thermostat is set to 101 or higher the body does this because some of the bodies defenses are activated at higher temperatures and some bacteria do not function well at higher temperatures so they die or we kill them better with a higher temperature so what is it when a fever breaks well eventually your white blood cells kill everything and they stop releasing those chemicals that changes the thermostat so the thermostat changes back to 98 6f now you have a temperature of 101f and your body is set to 98 6f it is too hot turn on the ac so you start sweating to cool yourself off this is a fever breaking so when the person with the fever is sweating like there is no tomorrow it is a good thing and you can probably expect the fever to start going back down fever is a natural defense mechanism against foreign invaders of your body it is very normal as long as my fever is not over 102f it makes sense to me to not interfere with the natural process even help it if i am running a little fever i will get in the hot tub or a nice hot bath fevers can be very dangerous and you should ask your doctor when those dangerous temperatures are they are different for kids and adults to answer the question the fastest easiest way to break a fever is with anti inflammatory medications like tylenol and motrin but that does not mean everything is all better and by the way water is zero calories in case you read the other post do not believe any of that stuff,['fever' 'baby' 'temperature'],-1

do pregnancy symptoms come and go or fade away during your first trimester,simple answer yes complex answer sometimes every pregnancy is different as your pregnancy progresses things like morning sickness can fade or come and go i have 4 children currently 20 weeks along with my 5th my first 2 both boys i was sick from day of conception to day of delivery my first daughter i had morning sickness till the third trimester my second daughter i had mild nausea the first trimester that went away by end of first trimester this preg i have had nausea that finally went away about 2 weeks ago tiredness usually eases near end of first trimester but comes back during third trimester if this your first take advantage of the rest while you can because once that baby is born you will not get much the first year or so between feedings and diaper changes that urge to pee every 20 or 30 minutes will ease up to a point near end of first trimester too but warning this comes back hard in third trimester if you have an active baby this can be worse and i strongly recommend keeping liners or incontenance pads or diapers on hand especially if you do not have the strongest bladder trust me all it really takes is 1 strong kick to the bladder and you canwill loose your bladder or have leakage keegle exercises help to strengthen muscles and can be done any time keep in mind that the more children you have the higher the likelyhood of having this issue hope this helps,['pregnancy' 'first trimester'],1
is there a safe breast enlagement supplement,this is a very good question thank you for asking blood pressure is read as two numbers such as 11070 the first number indicates the amount of pressure in your arteries when your heart contracts in a beat the second number indicates the pressure in your arteries while your heart is at rest between beats the difference between these two numbers is called your pulse pressure  for example if your pressure is 11070 that is a pulse pressure of 40 which is considered normal if your numbers are closer together such as 11090 you have a low pulse pressure in this example it would be 20 this can be an indication of poor heart function however the answer to your question depends a bit on how high the numbers are to begin with a blood pressure of 140100 for example would be considered high blood pressure  even though the pulse pressure of 40 is considered normal a blood pressure of 180160 would be considered extremely high blood pressure even though the pulse pressure of 20 would be considered low  if you have questions about your blood pressure in general i suggest you speak to your primary health care provider for an explanation that is specific to your case take care husband suffers from congenial heart diease blood pressure today is 8768 and has been low for a couple of days,['supplement'],-1

is there a connection between fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome,there are a lot of associations in medicine if you have x condition you are likely to suffer from y as well if you are at risk for a you are also at risk for b and probably c as well now we have a new connection to consider in my realm it appears that patients with fibromyalgia have a high prevalence of rls — restless leg syndrome fibromyalgia is a condition that affects the muscles and soft tissue it is considered the most common arthritis related illness after osteoarthritis and its hallmark symptoms include chronic pain in the muscles fatigue sleep problems and painful tender points or trigger points at certain parts of the body it can be difficult to diagnose because there is no single test for the ailment which is why doctors have to rule out other conditions before diagnosing fibromyalgia more than 12 million americans have fibromyalgia most of them are women ranging in age from 25 to 60 women are 10 times more likely to get this disease than men because of the toll fibromyalgia takes on people physically it is no surprise that patients have a harder time getting a good night is sleep as they endure chronic aches and pain but the link found between fibro patients and rls is intriguing fibromyalgia and restless legs syndrome share certain features * women are more likely to suffer from fibromyalgia and rls * there appears to be a genetic component because these conditions run in families rls is equally a mysterious disorder in the sense that we do not know exactly what causes it and as such we do not have a magic bullet for curing it in everyone sometimes an iron deficiency can be to blame for which there is a clear remedy but many patients with rls do not fit into a tidy category whereby the direct cause is known other problems that are sometimes linked to restless legs syndrome include kidney failure rheumatoid arthritis diabetes nerve damage anemia and parkinson is disease but most people who seek treatment do not have any of these other problems pregnancy accounts for many rls cases and contributes to the gender disparity and women who get rls during pregnancy often find that the condition vanishes after giving birth the scientists who published the study on this association pointed out that fibromyalgia and rls share several characteristics both conditions can include sensory alterations the use of antidepressants that can influence the dopamine system and beneficial effects for exercise what is more an important implication of the study according to the researchers is that restless legs syndrome is treatable with drugs that change the dopamine patterns in the brain physicians are urged to ask fibromyalgia patients about symptoms such as leg movements when they are trying to sleep and unpleasant sensations in their legs it goes without saying that alleviating these symptoms can enhance a fibromyalgia patient is experience with sleep and overall quality of life and it,['fibromyalgia' 'restless legs syndrome'],1

will you be able to get frost bite exposing your hands for 10 minutes in 30 degrees a friend of mine said that she was driving a person home who did not want the defroster on in the car so in order to have the window defrosted she had to put the windows down for less than 10 minutes the temperature outside was 35 degrees so is it possible for this person to get frost bite,it is certainly not likely frostbite is the term we use when our body is tissue literally freezes as you can imagine this process can take quite some time commonly frostbite occurs when bare skin is exposed to sub freezing temperatures for a prolonged period of time the process can occur faster if the bare skin is for example engulfed in snow or ice and covered tissue like skin fingers toes etc  is not protected from frostbite either many people have had their toes frozen by standing in knee deep snow for hours even while wearing heavy boots driving with the car windows down for 10 minutes in 35 degree weather is not likely to produce frostbite even if it did it would probably only produce a very mild case involving a few skin layers hope this answers your question,['frostbite' 'hand' 'temperature'],1

have a 7yo authistic who often put stuffs in his ears mostly torn paper pcs he moves and we cant take it out we have a 7 year old autistic who often put stuffs in his ears mostly torn paper pieces its very difficult to remove it with pullers carefully because he moves his head around knowing we are doing stuffs in his ears and like as if he does not want it removed this time however its impossible for us to remove it its a plastic bead slightly squeezed in a choke point in the ear canal his autism is mild to severe that he still does not talk or understand anything and we do not know what to do,plastic beads can be challenging to remove and that is speaking from a seasoned medical provider who has removed hundreds of them over the years mostly from children who are not autistic i have special instruments and can use directed light and magnification i suspect that do not have these tools or the skills unless you can gently irrigate out his ear with a stream of warm water from a hand held shower while both of you are in the bathtub or shower then it would be wise not to attempt it using any type of instrumentation may hurt him if it scratches the sensitive ear canal or may rupture his eardrum as much as i know you hate to do this you will either need to take him to see his medical provider see an ent or go to the er he can be restrained a bit or even slightly sedated but that bead needs to get out of there,['ears' 'movement' 'autism' 'head' 'choking'],1

is it better to wash your face before you exercise and sweat,yes a healthy immune system assuming you have one will handle strep throat the reason why we try and detect and treat strep is to prevent the possible complications of strep namely heart or kidney disease i suspect that most people have had strep in their lifetime only to have it resolve spontaneously but that does not mean you should not seek medical care if you have any of the signs of strep bright red dotted throat fever etc  if you do have strep and you are one of those rare people that develop a complication money will be the least of your problems while medical care is expensive just like getting your car repaired you still have to open that wallet sometimes and take care of yourself if you do not have insurance the answer is no strep is caused bacteria called streptococcus and without medication it can lead to more serious problems such as rheumatic fever and heart problems although some people are strep carriers and show no signs or symptoms people who are experiencing signs of symptoms should be treated accordingly by a physician signs could include fever headache body chills and or a sore throat most often it is easier to tell when a sore throat is from the influenza or do to a cold strep most often is not accompanied by coughing or a runny nose,['sweating' 'exercise'],-1

avoid stem cell pills if have lupus is blue green algae a stem cell rejuvenator,i am sorry to hear you are coping with lupus or at least that is how it sounds it is a nasty disease to clarify your question there is no such thing as stem cell pills  stem cells currently are used only in research and even then only for research into very specific conditions i am not sure what a stem cell rejuvenator would be this sounds like marketing hype to me blue green algae is a supplement generally considered safe for most people to take at the very least it probably will not harm you assuming you are not allergic to it blue green algae is often touted as being high in protein  but you would have to take it in massive quantities to achieve the amount of protein you would get from say a glass of milk according to the webmd article i linked above blue green algae is currently being studied for any positive effect on the immune system if it does support immune health and there is no definitive answer to that question yet it could be beneficial to someone with lupus often when a person has a chronic disease like lupus they will try almost anything to cure their symptoms or at least find relief from them please do not fall for any marketing hype and waste your money on products that have not been proven to help with lupus symptoms rely on your health care provider is advice in terms of medications and heed the healthy living advice you find from reputable sources like the national institutes of health and the lupus foundation of america best wishes to you,['lupus' 'stem cell'],1

avoid stem cell pills if have lupus is blue green algae a stem cell rejuvenator,that is a great question bravo to you for taking a moment to question the conventional wisdom there are actually a few reasons why we exhort people to drink plenty of fluids when they come down with a cold let is take a look at these first drinking plenty of fluids literally can increase your blood volume and thereby scatter the virus molecules in your system so your own immune system can fight it better think of it this way which is the easier enemy to attack the one with 500 soldiers concentrated together or the one with bands of 10 soldiers dispersed here and there drinking fluid can spread out the virus in your bloodstream so it is easier to attack honestly though drinking fluids by mouth can only do so much in this regard intravenous fluids iv work much better for this purpose second drinking plenty of fluids tends to thin secretions    i e  that nasty gunk that pours from your nose and gets coughed up out of your lungs thinner secretions are easier for the body to move than thick sticky ones thick sticky fluids can get stuck in the lower portions of the lungs and lead to pneumonia if your body can not cough them up in this respect drinking fluids by mouth truly can make a difference in helping your body clear out mucus finally good hydration helps medication work better if you take any sort of over the counter cough and cold product or if you are taking a prescription such as antibiotics it requires liquid water is best to dissolve well in your stomach and get absorbed in the intestines drinking plenty of water also helps your body circulate the active ingredients in those medications more easily so they work better frankly drinking plenty of water and being well hydrated when you have a cold simply can make you feel better water should always be your first choice but chicken soup can not hurt either wishing you well,['lupus' 'stem cell'],-1

my daughter has these bumps on her arm and i can not seem to figure out what it is,i am sorry to hear about your troubles i am glad you made an appointment with your surgeon because that was the best action you could take if you are not allergic to any medications you could try some over the counter pain relievers for this but if you are in a lot of pain i imagine you have already tried that you can try combining acetaminophen tylenol with a non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid like ibuprofen to see if that gives you better relief just do not exceed the maximum daily dosing of either medication you also might try applying heat or cold or alternating the application of heat and cold remember never to place a heating pad or ice pack directly on the skin the usual regimen for either one is 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off if none of that works you might call your neurosurgeon is office and ask to speak to his or her nurse or physician assistant pa they may be able to help you with some pain medication to manage your pain until you can be seen good luck to you,['bumps on her arm'],-1

how bald do i have to be for rogaine to work for me can i use topical rogaine and propecia pills at the same time  how long does it take to see an improvement in my hair,this is a great question and there are actually several questions in there so i will try to address all of them for you first of all the sooner you start using the products whether it is rogaine andor propecia the better off you are because it is much easier to prevent the hair loss than it is to try to fix it afterwards so as soon as you think the hair is starting to shed whether it is in the temple area or in the crown that is when you start going the other good point is that using propecia and rogaine together is better than using either one alone so it does not become like one and one is two it is more like one and one is four or five so they are that much better together it takes about two to three months to begin to see results and in about two years you will get the maximum that you are going to get out of them so not only do these products help prevent hair loss they actually help regrow hair and over time you will see that continue and in about two years you will hit that stabilization point,[''],1

i have one purple nipple it is acts weird i am 16 just had my period and when it stopped only one nipple became very sore and part if my armpit also the nipple was first very pink and today it was almost purple when i woke up it has a normal shape it is not swollen it acts completely different from tr other nipple like sometimes it is pointy and the other is not i am only worried because everywhere i research it says if only one breast nipple has an issue it is and issue but not if it is happening to both btw i do not have sex,i am sorry your daughter went through this i hope she has been successfully treated for her anorexia and bulimia the symptoms you describe could be caused by many things and only a health care professional can tell for sure what caused this episode however if indeed this was an isolated incident one likely cause of these symptoms is low blood sugar  hypoglycemia  if a person does not eat regularly or if they work too hard and neglect their health overall their blood sugar can drop and cause precisely the symptoms you describe in a case like that giving sugar is the best remedy crackers would do the trick because the carbohydrates would quickly be converted to simple sugars if the crackers and water made your daughter feel better chances are good this was just an episode of hypoglycemia your daughter can avoid future episodes by taking care of herself including eating quality foods on a regular schedule drinking plenty of water and exercising with her history of anorexia and bulimia it is important she maintains healthy non compulsive eating and exercise habits if she needs help with this she should see a psychologist who specializes in eating disorders often these services are available on a sliding fee scale i want to emphasize i am only speculating about one possible cause for your daughter is episode getting to the root cause of what happened requires a physical exam and some blood testing your daughter needs to find a way to obtain medical care not only because of what happened with the fainting but to help manage her health eating disorders anxiety and tobacco use wishing you all well,['nipple' 'period' 'armpit' 'swelling' 'breast'],-1

what causes veins protruding on the forehead  from behind the right ear to the middle of the forehead appears a bulging vein what is it,it is hard to answer a question like this without a physical examination i can give you some general thoughts on this matter 1 what you are observing could be perfectly normal a vein can appeal to be bulging if a person has very pale skin for example you might look to see if the corresponding vein on the opposite side also appears to be bulging or you might gently press on the vein to see if it feels engorged and stiff especially as compared to the same vein on the left if so then i would suggest you see your primary care provider 2 high blood pressure can cause veins all over the body to bulge it is not uncommon to see bulging veins in the head due to high blood pressure that is another reason why if the vein truly is bulging it would be a good idea to see a doctor please note i am not trying to give any advice specific to your situation these are just general observations whenever you are experiencing something out of the ordinary or something you feel is abnormal it is always ok to see a doctor or other health care provider for an evaluation wishing you all the best,['ears' 'forehead' 'vein'],1

what illnesses often co exist with bipolar disorder,‘tis the season i love that this is the time of year for one of the most powerful antioxidants we can eat the great news for us is that in november and december most grocery stores carry fresh and organic cranberries the age old jelly out of a can that is traditionally served at thanksgiving does not hold a candle to the different varieties of things you can do with fresh ingredients whole cranberries are extremely tart so you will need to sweeten them i usually use agave nectar but you can use brown sugar honey or regular sugar depending on the amount in the morning you can add some frozen or fresh whole berries into a smoothie for a tart and unusual flavor blend with strawberry blueberries or raspberries these berries are also excellent to add to a high fiber muffin  take the fresh cranberries into lunch and dinner by using as a spread on a turkey sandwich or served with grilled chicken a simple cooked sauce made with juice and zest of an orange agave nectar and cranberries can be chilled and served with brie cheese for an appetizer another great use for fresh cranberries is baked in a dessert with apples or pears the combination of color texture and taste is fantastic again you may have to add a tablespoon of extra agave or sugar to balance out the tartness of the cranberry one of my favorite and more unusual recipes made with fresh cranberries is my cranberry balsamic and mint relish this takes only minutes to make in your food processor you put fresh cranberries orange zest brown sugar fresh ginger mint and balsamic vinegar pulse it and store for up to one week this mix is great on your holiday buffet for turkey but it is also a surprisingly delicious mix for a holiday martini  so the next time you are at the store take a walk through the produce aisle for a few extra seconds and pick yourself up this antioxidant treat,['bipolar disorder'],-1

how can prostate cancer advanced or metastatic be prevented,hi here is a bit of info i found its interesting being it is about re cum can i get pregnant from pre cum pre cum or pre ejaculatory fluid to call it by it is correct name is a clear fluid that appears on the tip of the penis when a man has an erection and is sufficiently sexually excited it is a common misconception that this fluid is semen that has leaked out before the main ejaculation this is incorrect because this fluid is produced by something called the cowper gland and it is purpose is to flush out the penis before ejaculation so can you get pregnant from pre ejaculatory fluid pre cum well as this fluid does not contain sperm it can not by itself cause a pregnancy however as the purpose of this fluid is to flush out the penis it will bring any sperm left in the penis from the last ejaculation to the tip of the penis if this happens that small amount of sperm could cause a pregnancy if the man has urinated since his last ejaculation the urine would have flushed out and killed any left over sperm in the penis which means in this case a pregnancy would not happen the safest thing is to assume that an erect penis is always capable of causing a pregnancy even before an ejaculation so cover it with a condom before it comes in contact with the vagina good luck,['prostate cancer'],-1

how much extra food should i eat while pregnant,pregnancy hormones can play havoc with appetite causing some women to feel famished others are daunted by nausea vomiting and fatigue that diminish their desire for food in both cases the best strategy is trying as much as possible to adhere to a balanced diet that accounts for physical activity and stage of pregnancy like the ones offered at mypyramid gov a nutritious pregnancy eating plan with adequate calories    about 340 more calories each day than your prepregnancy needs starting in the second trimester and about 450 more than your prepregnancy diet during the last three months of pregnancy    should be enough to prevent constant hunger women who are particularly physically active during pregnancy may need more calories however choosing foods that fill you up as part of a balanced pregnancy diet improves eating satisfaction for example whole grains vegetables and legumes are filled with fiber to keep you fuller for longer without any extra calories drink plenty of fluids it works with fiber to keep you full and to prevent constipation a common pregnancy complaint,['pregnancy' 'food'],1

will i be fined for failing to buy health insurance i am 53 and make 12 000 a year,this question was sparked no doubt by the much talked about individual mandate which is a central component of the health reform law with some exceptions this provision would require all u s citizens to purchase health insurance or face a penalty beginning in 2014 at 53 with an annual income of 12 000 this reader would likely qualify for medicaid starting in 2014 states will receive additional funding from the federal government to cover the cost of extending medicaid benefits if you are an individual making 14 000 per year or a family of four earning 29 000 or less 133 percent of the federal poverty level you would receive health benefits via medicaid and avoid paying a penalty helping the middle class pay for insurance for the middle class tax credits will be made available to help pay for health plans purchased through health insurance exchanges that will be set up by 2014 if you are an individual making 43 000 or less or a family of four making less than 88 000 the government will subsidize your insurance premiums you may also be eligible for reduced co payments coinsurance and deductibles to assist with the cost of coverage but if you fail to obtain insurance you will be penalized here is how it breaks down starting in 2014 the tax penalty will be 95 and that amount will gradually increase to the greater of 695 per year for individuals 2085 per family or 2 5 percent of a household is income there will be exemptions for financial hardship the individual mandate    a little background the individual mandate was included in the new law as a way of paying for an additional 30 million uninsured americans to have insurance by requiring everyone to pay into the system this is one the most hotly debated aspects of the new law a number of lawsuits have been filed around the country questioning whether or not it is constitutional to require americans to purchase a product in this case health insurance recent rulings in michigan and virginia upheld the new law however earlier this week a federal judge in richmond va ruled against it saying that the individual mandate to purchase health insurance violates the constitution all this is to say that there will be many legal battles between now and 2014 when this mandate is scheduled to take effect ultimately the decision as to whether it is legal for the government to require people to purchase health insurance will likely fall to the supreme court,['insurance' 'health insurance' 'affordable care act' 'medicaid'],1

what happens to someone when they get malaria,when you are bitten by a malaria  infected mosquito the parasites that cause malaria are injected into your blood and invade your liver cells the parasite reproduces in the liver cells which then burst open allowing thousands of new parasites to enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells the parasites reproduce again in the blood cells kill the blood cells and then move to other uninfected blood cells the time from the initial malaria infection until symptoms appear incubation period generally ranges from 1 9 to 14 days for plasmodium p  falciparum 12 to 18 days for p vivax and p ovale 18 to 40 days for p malariae 11 to 12 days for p knowlesi symptoms can appear in 7 days occasionally the time between exposure and signs of illness may be as long as 8 to 10 months with p vivax and p ovale because these parasites can survive in the human liver for a long time the incubation period may be longer if you are taking medicine to prevent infection chemoprophylaxis or have developed partial immunity due to previous infections malaria can begin with flu  like symptoms in the early stages infection from p falciparum is similar to infection from p vivax p malariae and p ovale you may have no symptoms or symptoms that are less severe if you are immune or partially immune to malaria common malaria symptoms include fever chills and a rapidly rising temperature headaches nausea and extreme sweating symptoms may appear in cycles the time between episodes of fever and other symptoms varies with the specific parasite you are infected with episodes of symptoms may occur every 48 hours if you are infected with p vivax or p ovale every 72 hours if you are infected with p malariae p falciparum does not usually have a regular cyclic fever after the early stages life threatening complications develop rapidly with p falciparum and p knowlesi and if untreated may result in irreversible complications or death 2 if untreated you may recover in a week to a month or longer after being infected with p vivax p malariae or p ovale malaria can be a very serious disease for a pregnant woman and her unborn baby  fetus  and for young children medication choices are limited for a pregnant woman or a child infection with p falciparum can lead to death for a pregnant woman and her fetus for these reasons a pregnant woman should not travel to an area where she could get p falciparum malaria visit the cdc web site www cdc govmalariatravelindex htm to find out whether malaria is a problem in the country where you will be traveling malaria recurrences malaria caused by p falciparum may come back recur at irregular intervals for up to 2 years if treatment is not complete malaria caused by p vivax and p ovale may recur at irregular intervals for up to 3 to 4 years but medication treatment,['malaria'],1

when is the flu no longer contagious,the rule of thumb is that [you are no longer contagious] when you do not have a fever for more than 24 hours and did not take any medications to help reduce the fever when you do not have a fever your not contagious according to the u s cdc most healthy adults may be able to infect others beginning 1 day before symptoms develop and up to 5 to 7 days after becoming sick children may pass the virus for longer than 7 days symptoms start 1 to 4 days after the virus enters the body that means that you may be able to pass on the flu to someone else before you know you are sick as well as while you are sick some persons can be infected with the flu virus but have no symptoms during this time those persons may still spread the virus to others  according to the center for disease control you are contagious for 1 4 days before you ever become sick with the flu so if you are not running fever but are still contagious before the fever comes then how can you still not be contagious for at least 5 days after you stop having fever evidently the flu doesnt need fever to be contagious in the beginning after fever subsides,['flu'],1

will i be able to keep the coverage i have now once health reform goes into effect,this answer depends upon your current coverage if you are among the nearly 60 percent of americans who receive coverage through your employer it is likely not much will change but it depends many insurance plans generally change on their own from year to year regarding what they will cover and for how much unrelated to the health reform law those that do not change substantially will be considered “grandfathered plans” and are not subject changes made by the affordable care act aca those that do change must comply with the aca by instituting new insurance reforms such as not excluding individuals with pre existing conditions and banning lifetime limits on coverage the biggest changes occur in health insurance exchanges and the medicaid program every state will operate a marketplace where private health plans can compete for individuals called the “health insurance exchange ” states may choose to also expand medicaid to anyone who earns up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level  15 856 for a single person in 2013 offering more coverage options for low income americans finally if you receive coverage through medicare your plan is largely unchanged,['medicare' 'health insurance' 'affordable care act' 'medicaid'],1

what should my heart rate be during exercise,calculate your target heart rate with a formula called the heart rate reserve method recommends richard weil med cde use a watch with a second hand to keep track of how many times your heart beats per minute you can feel your heartbeat at the underside of your wrist or along the side of your neck here is how to use the formula determine your maximum heart rate mhr by subtracting your age from 220 then subtract your resting heart rate it is best to take this when you first wake up in the morning from your maximum heart rate to find your heart rate reserve hrr multiply your hrr by the percentage of your mhr at which you wish to train 60 to 85 is the usual range for people looking to increase fitness and health add your resting heart rate back to that result to get your target rate so assuming an age of 27 a resting heart rate of 70 beats per minute and a desired training range of 70 the calculation would look like this 220   27 = 193 193   70 = 123 123 x 70 = 86 86 + 70 = 156 remember this is an estimate not an absolute also keep in mind that athletes may exceed the training zone and even the maximum heart rate during high intensity training,['exercise' 'pulse'],1

i had the brilliant idea to inject my my husbands semen into my uterus,so there is lots of sounds that can keep people awake but there is also sounds that can allow people to fall asleep let is talk about the awake sounds just for a moment if you look at the sounds that are going to wake people up they actually are different oftentimes by gender a perfect example of this would be the baby cry okay moms hear the babies barely cry dads sleep through baby cries what is interesting is it really depends on the dad we are not 100 convinced that dads actually sleep through the baby cry but they may pretend to sleep through the baby cry and so hoping that the mother will get up and and deal with the child because a lot of dads are not necessarily in that role in our house i can hear my kids cry almost before it gets out of their mouth and i am dashing across the house whereas my wife is absolutely out cold so it can vary quite a bit smoke alarm is one of the things that you will obviously that you are tuned in to hear to listen for when somebody breaks a window or you feel that somebody is breaking into the home those are types of sounds that you will hear another pretty disturbing bed sound could be your bed partner everything from snoring to gas to whatever it is can keep people awake interesting statistic they found that individuals that sleep next to someone who snores lose approximately one hour of sleep every night you sleep next to somebody that snores for 8 nights you have lost an entire night is worth of sleep that is a scary statistic but it is quite true so there is a lot of things that can have that effect what can we do to help ourselves with that believe it or not earplugs turn out to be a very good resource but you want to get your earplugs noise level rated in that you do not want the rating to be above 32 the reason being then you can not hear the baby cry or you can not hear the smoke alarm so and looking for those foamy earplugs that you can find almost anywhere actually turn about to be a very good option another thing we have found is that there is data to suggest that listening to ocean sounds will actually help people relax and fall asleep but a babbling brook or rain may make you want to go to the bathroom so you need to be pretty careful about the sounds that you are going to be hearing because some of them are going to have different reactions to you okay do i have a problem with people sleeping with music no but metallica is probably not the best to fall asleep to although there are probably plenty of people out there who can fall asleep to that you want music without,['symptoms up and down fever 95* - 102.5 and body aches including teeth even hurting'],-1

how will doctors find out if a woman and her partner have fertility problems,sometimes doctors can find the cause of a couple is infertility by doing a complete fertility evaluation this process usually begins with physical exams and health and sexual histories if there are no obvious problems like poorly timed intercourse or absence of ovulation tests will be needed for a man doctors usually begin by testing his semen they look at the number shape and movement of the sperm sometimes doctors also suggest testing the level of a man is hormones for a woman the first step in testing is to find out if she is ovulating each month there are several ways to do this at home or doctors can also check if a woman is ovulating by doing blood tests and an ultrasound of the ovaries if the woman is ovulating normally more tests are needed some common tests of fertility in women include hysterosalpingography in this test doctors use x rays to check for physical problems of the uterus and fallopian tubes laparoscopy during this surgery doctors use a tool called a laparoscope to see inside the abdomen using the laparoscope doctors check the ovaries fallopian tubes and uterus for disease and physical problems doctors can usually find scarring and endometriosis by laparoscopy,['fertility'],1

how does botox help migraine headaches,botox can prevent migraine headaches this was first noted by a plastic surgeon who was using it to treat wrinkles and found that his patients told him they had fewer headaches botox is currently being extensively studied as a preventive medication for a variety of headaches including in migraine sufferers with chronic daily headache meaning having headaches more than 16 days out of the month with the early data showing that it is effective in reducing the number of headaches in these people the medicine is injected into specific areas in the front and side of the head botox has not yet been approved for this use although the studies being carried out are designed to be suitable for fda approval the mechanism of action by which botox prevents headaches is unknown it may work by directly affecting the muscles being injected or it may be transported to and act in other sites in the body such as the brain,['migraine' 'headache'],1

abnormal ekg  i am 15 and have anxiety i came to er with panic attack and my heart racing and they listened with stethoscope i was not convinced so wanted ekg they said i was fine but it said abnormal ekg any concerns i had my heart listened to after and before this and was fine but this thing,i have gone back and forth with the depo injections and oral contraceptives for the last decade or so i can not decide which is the lesser of the evils there are certainly pros and cons to each but in the end i decided to stick with the oral contraceptives why although convenient you only go in every quarter or so for a shot but like you i have gained quite a bit of weight after the initial shot and my weight continue to skyrocket with each injection after about three years i have gained a total of about 13 of my pre depo body weight not only was my body image suffering since the injections but my moods swings were swinging at full force i was tired all the time and my calcium levels were fast depleting i loved the convenience of not having to take the pill on a daily basis but side effects of the injections turned me into someone who i ultimately hate now that i am back on the pill most of the side effects i have suffered from the depo has left my system and i am somewhat back to my pre depo body weight but i am feeling so much more energized and alive i did not know the extent of the side effects until i decided on another form of birth control true the pill may be a pain in the rear for someone as forgetful as i am but i would rather forget and have to use a backup method than to suffer the ill effects the depo injections birth control is a definite must for some women myself included and i have accepted the fact that there are side effects to any substance we take but it should not interfere with our daily lives and turn us into someonesomething we are not with this experience i have learned that depo injections just did not work for me but it may for others in the end i think you should have an in depth discussion with your gyn weigh your options and figure which will work best for you based on your needs your lifestyle and your preference,['anxiety' 'panic attack' 'heart'],-1

i have colon cancer stage 3b i have abdomen pain mri of omentum and lesions of concern,as a plastic and reconstructive surgery nurse i worked with many women who had large breasts that caused rashes or neck pain here is what i can tell you the type of procedure you are looking for is breast reduction not augmentation breast reduction surgery will reduce the overall size of your breasts as well as perking them up  so they sit in a more natural position many insurance companies will cover breast reduction under certain conditions for example serious neck pain that does not respond to any other treatment like physical therapy and can be attributed to large breasts may be covered with rashes insurance companies seem in my experience less likely to cover breast reduction unless the rashes recur frequently and have not responded to other treatments you need to have documentation that you have seen your primary care provider multiple times and have tried prescription creams or whatever without clearing up the rashes for more than short periods of time also with rashes your insurance may be less likely to cover the procedure if you are obese because in theory reducing the size of your abdomen might help the rash problem if you have tried without success to medically treat the rashes i would suggest you schedule an appointment with a plastic and reconstructive surgeon to discuss your options he or she will not be able to tell you if your insurance will cover a breast reduction but the surgeon can give you an opinion on whether you might benefit from breast reduction and can submit the claim for prior authorization after that it is up to the individual insurer you need to know that breast reduction can impair your ability to nurse a baby it is doubtful you would be completely unable to nurse but removing breast tissue does reduce the number of milk ducts which can reduce the volume of milk your baby is able to get from nursing hope this helps,['colon cancer stage 3b' 'omentum'],-1

what new procedures are being considered for bags under the eyes,last week i attended a two day seminar on plastic surgery at the cedars sinai medical center here in the beverly hills area it was excellent we had terrific speakers from various sub specialties including facial plastic surgery general plastic surgery ophthalmic plastic surgery and cosmetic dermatology one of the more interesting subjects was how we surgeons now view the treatment of the aging lower eyelids because of the stellar performance of filling solutions such as restylane juvaderm perlane sculptra radiesse and artefill we are exploring new roles for these products the sense now is that we can be more conservative about taking out the extra fatty tissue of the lower eyelids one reason is that often the fat bag prominence is partly due to shrinkage of the fat over the cheek bones just below the lower eyelid fat bag so the contrast between the bulging of the fat and the flatness of the adjacent cheek tissue renders the fat more visible and unsatisfactory consequently many surgeons are evaluating the appearance that follows after merely using filling injections along the lower rim of the orbital bone in other words the hill does not look so high when you fill the adjacent valley for many patients that is all they need some patients will still need a chemical skin peel or laser treatment to help tighten the lower eyelid skin is fine lines or wrinkles others have darkness of the skin which is the most difficult problem and our scientific artillery is not yet good enough consistently for that although there are some new bleach creams that seem promising i enjoy attending these continuing medical education seminars because we collectively are probing and searching — always — for better and safer treatments for patients such is the history of all medical practice for thousands of years remember “science never sleeps ”,['eyes'],1

is it common to have one ear infected yet have pain in the opposite ear  i went to the clinic after 10 days of having a clogged ear it felt as if there was fluid in my ear and my hearing was fuzzy i was diagnosed with an ear infection in the opposite ear not the one that was bothering me is this common i was given drops for the infected ear but my other ear still feels clogged what should i do,you may have two different types of ear problems the ear that was prescribed drops assuming these are antibiotic or antibioticsteroid drops you did not say would be for an external ear infection like swimmer is ear otitis externa your other ear that is painful could be due to middle ear pressure or even a middle ear infection in progress the eardrum may not have been red or bulging at the time of this exam but the pressure could still cause pain since i have no way of making that determination blindly over the internet you would need to contact that medical provider again    someone that can re examine your ear obviously an accurate diagnosis is the key to and effective treatment,['ears' 'fuzziness' 'pain' 'ear infection'],1
how will my doctor determine the best treatment for my prostate cancer,ok there are a number of different factors that play into whether this prostate cancer is going to be significant obviously we want to know the volume of the cancer is there a lot there obviously the more there is the worse it is and we want to know the grain how aggressive it is is this like a little puppy or is it like a doberman with rabies the more aggressive the cancer the worse the prognosis the more likely you will need aggressive therapy and the larger volume also has a role and we also do studies to evaluate has it spread is it just in one little area or has it spread so that is the two factors that we look at in determining how aggressive this cancer will or will not be for you then we have to look at the factors that relate to you what is your health what is your age how old were your parents when they died if not if your father died at age 50 and you are 47 then    sl ok we will go back to that so um if your father is 50 years old when he died and you are 47 then we may not be as aggressive with higher risk treatments if on the other hand you are 57 and your father is 94 and still active vibrant healthy then we need to consider that you probably have 40 years ahead of you and we will be more aggressive we also need to look at your health if you have any heart disease blood vessel disease diabetes if you are out climbing mountains and hiking the grand canyon and you are 63 then we are going to want to be more aggressive as well so all of those factors go into determining the nature of what the threat is because we never want the treatment worse than the disease we know that for the majority of men prostate cancer will not kill them so we want to customize treatment if you are young and healthy we may be more aggressive if you are old and have health problems we probably will not,['prostate cancer'],1

i have recently been diagnosed with hsp henoch schonlein purpura doctors are worried my kidneys might be at risk need second opinion,clinical symptoms associated with travel to countries that have identified malarial risk suggest malaria as a diagnosis malaria tests are not routinely ordered by most physicians so recognition of travel history is essential unfortunately many diseases can mimic symptoms of malaria for example yellow fever dengue fever typhoid fever cholera filariasis and even measles and tuberculosis consequently physicians need to order the correct special tests to diagnose malaria especially in industrialized countries where malaria is seldom seen without the travel history it is likely that other tests will be ordered initially in addition the long incubation periods may tend to allow people to forget the initial exposure to infected mosquitoes the classic and most used diagnostic test for malaria is the blood smear on a microscope slide that is stained giemsa stain to show the parasites inside red blood cells although this test is easily done correct results are dependent on the technical skill of the lab technician who prepares and examines the slides with a microscope other tests based on immunologic principles exist including rdts rapid diagnostic tests approved for use in the u s in 2007 and polymerase chain reaction pcr tests these are not yet widely available and are more expensive than the traditional giemsa blood smear some investigators suggest such immunologic based tests be confirmed with a giemsa blood smear,['doctors are worried my kidneys might be at risk'],-1

can a type 1 diabetic use over the counter sinus and allergy medicine,before using any over the counter medication diabetics should first discuss with their doctor whether the medication is safe and appropriate a common medication used for runny noses is a decongestant decongestants are available either as a pill or as a nasal spray common decongestants found in pill form include pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine both of these ingredients may raise blood glucose and blood pressure levels people with diabetes should only use decongestants cautiously and under the direction of a doctor because of its misuse and side effects pseudoephedrine is found behind the pharmacy counter this measure means that pharmacists can make sure that pseudoephedrine is being used appropriately phenylephrine may be found on the store shelves remember that many cold medications contain multiple ingredients be sure to read carefully all the ingredients in a preparation many cold preparations contain non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids such as ibuprofen advil or naproxen aleve these agents can be harmful to the kidneys of diabetics and if pain is not an issue may not be needed therefore buying separate ingredients rather than a combination medication may be safer a nasal decongestant works more quickly than a decongestant taken by mouth this preparation is sprayed into each nostril nasal decongestants usually do not have a significant effect on blood glucose or blood pressure levels because their effect is mainly local however if used excessively they can have effects on glucose and blood pressure the important downside to nasal decongestants is a possible rebound effect that makes your nose even more congested if you use them for more than 3 to 5 days for that reason they are best for short lived colds and not for persistent allergies saline nasal sprays are safe for diabetics and do no affect blood glucose levels nasal strips are another good option and are available over the counter the strips work by mechanically opening the nostrils antihistamines are a commonly used for a runny nose antihistamines can help dry a runny nose due to an allergy but are not helpful for a runny nose due to the common cold antihistamines do not raise blood glucose levels and are usually safe for diabetics however some of the older over the counter antihistamines cause sleepiness this can be a real problem in diabetics especially when combined with sedatives or alcohol diphenhydramine benadryl is an antihistamine that causes sleepiness but fexofenadine allegra loratadine claritin and cetirizine zyrtec are less sedating the most important step though in treating your symptoms is to be sure you have the correct diagnosis go over your symptoms and signs with your doctor many times what seems to be an allergy may in fact be a bacterial sinus infection bacterial sinus infections are common in diabetics and need to be treated with antibiotics which are only available by prescription so do not rush out and buy an over the counter preparation without first talking with your provider,['diabetes' 'sinus' 'over the counter'],1

what happens if all of the sac from a sebaceous cyst is not removed,i am sorry you are going through this and that it is concerning you the skin is an amazing organ one thing it does is function as sort of a radiator for the body in the sense that blood vessels in the skin is surface become enlarged to release heat when the core of the body gets too warm this engorgement of the blood vessels in the skin can cause flushing a red appearance and may make the skin feel hot the body releases excess heat this way in order to avoid overheating the core i guess my question would be why is your body getting so hot at midday is it because you are exercising for example are you going through menopause and experiencing hot flashes or do you just get unbearably hot at the same time every day our body temperature tends to fluctuate throughout the day but if you are getting uncomfortably hot every day at the same time with no known cause it would be worth discussing this with your doctor at your next visit i mean it sounds as if your body is functioning normally your core gets hot so your skin releases the heat but perhaps there is some underlying cause for this that should be checked out i wish you all the best with this,['epidermal cyst'],-1

what is myopathy,fiber is typically beneficial in alleviating constipation but too much without enough water can actually cause constipation keep in mind that there are two types of fiber soluble and insoluble soluble fiber slows digestion and helps you absorb nutrients from food where insoluble fiber adds bulk to your stool helping it to pass more quickly through the intestines most plant foods contain some of each but insoluble fiber is more common in wheat bran whole grains cereals seeds and the skins of many fruits and vegetables you may have added too much fiber too soon it might be beneficial to temporarily decrease your fiber intake for now so that you can slowly and gradually reintroduce it back into your diet allowing your body time to adjust to it better you are correct in drinking plenty of fluids since water is necessary to help fiber move stool out of your body if you eat too much fiber without enough water you can become constipated so it may be worthwhile to also drink more water even if you feel as though you are getting enough according to the academy of nutrition and dietetics women should aim for 25 grams of fiber per day and men should aim for 38 grams per day after the age of 50 the recommendations for fiber drop to 21 grams per day for women and 30 grams per day for men you and your doctor may discuss different needs based on your current health conditions another idea may be to try to incorporate foods that might have a natural laxative effect such as prunes psyllium seed husk bran and methylcellulose to alleviate your constipation some people just respond poorly to increases in fiber so it may be beneficial to discuss this further with your doctor thanks for your answer doctor i have stopped the fiber it was metamucil so it was psyillium and now i am back to normal i was also drinking double up on the water and my stomach doubled in size with the bloating i may try to do just one of the wafers a day instead of the 4 i worked my way up to but then again since my pain stopped and my stools resumed to normal i do not understand the need i also do eat fruit and vegetables already as well i think i will listen to my body rather than the you need to do this type of advise we are getting over all i can say in my case fiber is not the answer to life lol,[''],-1

i have a newly closed anal fistula i can feel a bulge from the fluid the pressure is very uncomfortable is it healing  it is drained for a couple years now the bubble of fluid feels like i have a marble up my rear i can push on the bubble and this forces the fluid back and it is comfortable for up to an hour but then the bubble fills back up is this normal is this just it finally healing,there is no way for a medical provider to blindly answer that question without an examination i am sorry i would suggest that you call your medical provider    someone who knows you and your particular case    for advise in this matter anal fissures are tiny tears or cracks they do not typically have bubbles so i would be concerned about a cyst or abscess forming,['anus' 'fistula' 'pressure' 'healing' 'drainage'],1

are fruit smoothies bad i have done very well at loosing weight and feeling better and i drink fresh fuit smoothies for breakfast that i make myself what i want to know is is there a danger to eating this during the work week every morning for breakfast i am not concerned about the weight dangers as i eat a lower calorie diet is there any bad effects of drinking these for breakfast on a regular basis,fruit smoothies are fine with the exception of those calories which can be surprisingly high not all smoothies are created equal you know if you are trying to lose weight i think it would be wise to limit these as a sole breakfast option once in a while is fine you will lose more weight and get a bit more mileage if you ate a piece of fruit and had some protein in the morning like an egg and a piece of dry toast less calories well no if fruits are healthy then fruit smoothies are not bad either but watch how much you take in because too much of anything including fruit smoothies can cause health problems like diabetes that ius when your body cannot process sugar so the food or drink will become extra body fat at the same time it is good to excersize so dont worry fruit smoothies are not bad for you,['drinking' 'weight' 'fruit' 'calorie' 'diet'],1

can physicians recommend a patient to take medication prescribed by another physican that they happen to have at home  my mother has just been diagnosed with gallstones instead of prescribing something for pain the doctor told her that she could take the oxycodone that she had from a dentist some time ago and had not used is this allowed i am appauled but do not know the legal and proper protocols,my response is intended to be helpful and offered with respect i would never protect the actions of a rouge doctor or support an inappropriate medical decision in my opinion this doctor did not cross any ethical or legal lines if you were appalled why did not you question this action when it was made the doctor could have immediately answered your question and explained their reasoning but was not given an opportunity you suggest in your question that the doctor should have prescribed something for pain well that is exactly what happened the oxycodone still in your mother is possession is used as an agent to control pain would you have felt better if the doctor had written a new prescription for oxycodone how did the doctor know that your mother still had oxycodone remaining from her dental treatment that information must have been volunteered by the patient upon learning that your mother already had pain medication available why not use it as long as the oxycodone was originally prescribed for your mother and had not reached its expiration date the doctor is action was acceptable perhaps the doctor wanted to save your mother time in waiting at the pharmacy or wanted to save her some money i can only guess the reasons for his decision in summary doctors are licensed to prescribe medications in various fashions these may include suggesting over the counter drugs providing the patient with factory packaged free sample drugs loose free sample medications placed in a bag with dosing instructions hand writing a new prescription for pharmacy dispensing directing office staff to administer medications provide over the phone orders to the pharmacy email and fax prescriptions sent directly to the pharmacy and even advising a patient to resume medications previously prescribed by another doctor they even have the authority to prescribe medications for conditions that were not intended or approved to be treated with that drug this practice is referred to as off label prescribing for example some anti seizure medications are also prescribed to treat pain mixed in with those prescription authorization practices and customs is the necessity to determine who really requires pain medications and who are the individuals that may be manipulating the system in order to feed a drug addiction or to make some street money doctors have awesome powers and responsibilities in properly prescribing medications they spent years studying anatomyphysiology chemistry biology disease processes and pharmacology they are keenly aware of approaches used to control pain and must first do no harm,['gallstone' 'pain' 'oxycodone'],1

are there any over the counter solutions for nausea and vomiting,this is a great question but of course as a pharmacist i have to ask the patient a few questions too because we need to find out what is the root cause could this be more of a virus running around and causing that nausea and vomiting because in that case it is really just flat coca cola syrup over some ice and just letting it pass if it becomes very violent though and they have not been able to keep any food or water down you have to go in the emergency room because dehydration could cause more problems down the road so you want to be really careful about that if you are pregnant once again you can not really take the over the counter products that are available such as meclizine basically known as dramamine or also bonine bonine is a chewable form of the product these are not safe in pregnant women so therefore they have to go more the natural route they could possibly try there is a wristband that they could wear around their wrist to help prevent that as well but if it is just for motion sickness because it was on a boat which is very common for people or a train the products that are available dramamine and bonine are quite effective they may cause a little bit of tiredness because they are actually antihistamines and by causing the drowsiness they are actually calming down the center in your brain that causes the nausea and vomiting but once again as a pharmacist i am going to ask my patients a few questions first before i can help you find the right choice,['nausea' 'vomit' 'over the counter'],1

why does diarrhea develop,with diarrhea stools usually are looser whether or not the frequency of bowel movements is increased this looseness of stool    which can vary all the way from slightly soft to watery    is caused by increased water in the stool during normal digestion food is kept liquid by the secretion of large amounts of water by the stomach upper small intestine pancreas and gallbladder food that is not digested reaches the lower small intestine and colon in liquid form the lower small intestine and particularly the colon absorb the water turning the undigested food into a more or less solid stool with form increased amounts of water in stool can occur if the stomach andor small intestine secretes too much fluid the distal small intestine and colon do not absorb enough water or the undigested liquid food passes too quickly through the small intestine and colon for enough water to be removed of course more than one of these abnormal processes may occur at the same time for example some viruses bacteria and parasites cause increased secretion of fluid either by invading and inflaming the lining of the small intestine inflammation stimulates the lining to secrete fluid or by producing toxins chemicals that also stimulate the lining to secrete fluid but without causing inflammation inflammation of the small intestine andor colon from bacteria or from ileitiscolitis can increase the rapidity with which food passes through the intestines reducing the time that is available for absorbing water conditions of the colon such as collagenous colitis can block the ability of the colon to absorb water diarrhea generally is divided into two types acute and chronic acute diarrhea lasts from a few days up to a week chronic diarrhea can be defined in several ways but almost always lasts more than three weeks it is important to distinguish between acute and chronic diarrhea because they usually have different causes require different diagnostic tests and require different treatment,['diarrhea'],1
can weight loss cause high blood pressure  i have lost 20 lbs through weight watchers i lost 10lbs then joined weight watchers for a total loss of 30 lbs  i have high blood pressure for a number of years controlled by medication diovan 80 mg once a day just recently i have noticed my blood pressure going up ex 177112 normally 13080 my dr increased the diovan to two tabs a day one am and one pm this rx is helping somewhat i am just wondering if significant weight loss can add to the high blood pressure  thank you  sandra deustachio,a fever is very non specific    there can be many things causing his fever but if he has an ear infection this is the most likely culprit most ear infections are preceded by a cold so even colds can cause fevers of this magnitude but unfortunately i do not know enough about your child or his particular case to know if something else is going on do not let a fever frighten you children can get some pretty impressive fevers medical providers rarely get excited with fevers under 105f in a one year old children tend to get higher fevers because their immune system is not very good the fever helps fight infection and their cooling system is not very efficient we cool by sweating over a large skin surface area so the smaller the body the less cooling most fevers should improve on day three or four of the illness but if it does not or if you child is experiencing any other worrisome symptoms you will need to have him re examined,['high blood pressure' 'weight' 'blood pressure' 'weight loss'],-1

is it better to apply heat or cold to sore muscles after stenuous exercise,most helpful answer everything i have read says cold if there is tissue damage the cold constricts blood flow which reduces spread of cellular components which can cause rupture of nearby cells making the injury worse and longer to heal heat is not usually applied to an injury until 72 hours have passed this is to increase circulation and promote healing more recent research shows movement of skeletal muscles produces hormone like substances that promote and speed healing of damaged or inflamed tissues throughout the body so if you can move do lastly a small meal of four parts carbs and one part protein within 90 minutes of exercise will help speed muscle recovery the body will use that energy and protein to quickly try to re construct those damaged tissues this information is from exercise physiology,['muscle' 'coldness' 'exercise'],1

what is the difference between the fat burning mode and the cardio mode on the machines at the gym,using the fat burning mode on exercise machines at the gym actually is not the best way to burn fat the key concepts to understand here are the percentage of calories that come from fat and total calories the fat burning mode is typically set at lower exercise intensity where more calories burned come from fat not as many calories burned during higher exercise intensity will come from fat the point to understand though is that while more of the calories that you burn will come from fat at a lower exercise intensity you have the potential to burn more calories per session doing higher exercise intensity the percentage of calories burned from fat will be lower during the higher exercise intensity but you will be burning more calories overall including the amount of calories from fat also higher exercise intensity leads to a greater boost in metabolism even after you are done exercising which burns additional calories it is best to do exercise that you are comfortable with and that meets your level of trainingconditioning in general however increasing the time spent on exercise and increasing exercise intensity will provide a greater potential to burn more calories and lose weight,['burn'],1

what is the recovery period for bilateral knee replacement,recovery from bilateral total knee arthroplasty can be very challenging those individuals that have gone through it can confirm it first hand like all things in medicine some people will recover quicker than others in our practice most people that undergo bilateral tka [total knee arthroplasty] spend some period of time in a rehabilitation center after leaving the inpatient setting i like to think that people are about 75 recovered at 6 weeks but it often seems like people make continued recovery all the way out to one year following surgery this seems to hold relatively true for patients following single tka and therefore you can imagine that the recovery process could be even longer and more challenging when both are done at the same time if you feel like you are making progress each day or week or even each month then you are probably headed to a good long term result there are certainly times that patients will get discouraged by the challenge of recovery but remember that the overwhelming majority of patients that have the operation experience improvement in pain function and quality of life,['period' 'knee'],1

what if one spouse receives employer sponsored health insurance and the other receives insurance through the exchange  will the spouse receiving insurance through the exchange be eligible for a subsidy based upon their individual income or will it be based on joint income if they file a joint irs return,well to be honest this is a question that can only be answered by your doctor there are so many factors that go into whether or not a hernia requires surgery that it is a highly individualized situation  hernia  is a term that refers to a condition in which fatty tissue or organs protrude through a weak spot in the muscles of the abdomen in men especially there is a naturally weak spot in the groin where the spermatic cord passes from the scrotum into the abdomen because of the natural muscle weakness in this area men are at risk of inadvertently pushing organs often the bowel wall into the inguinal canal through heavy lifting contact sports and other activities that place a lot of stress on that area as you pointed out many small hernias do not require treatment but this depends on where the hernia is located and how severe it is if your doctor recommends surgery you should listen carefully even a small hernia can require repair if it involves a piece of bowel or bladder tissue tissue trapped in a hernia can die and this can have severe health consequences so do not think just because a doctor referred to a hernia as small that this alone determines whether or not it requires treatment in the meantime you might ask your doctor if you should avoid heavy lifting or contact sports as these can make the hernia worse wishing you well,[''],-1

do they really work to remove blackheads and how do they work,the single worst thing you can do to a pimple is pick these are not surgical instruments you should not be doing this to your skin so i do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue but i also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar so anytime you pick at the skin in any way whether it is using the tool or your fingers you do have some risk of scarring so every pimple blackhead whitehead or a pustule or papule all starts out as a same thing our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles which are called pores at the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well called p acnes for some reason which we do not fully understand why that is the opening of the follicle can become blocked and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go it can not get to the surface so as it builds up it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white that is a whitehead if it opens to the surface it gets oxidized and that is a blackhead so a blackhead is not dark because it is dirty it is dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark if there is a p acnes bacteria that is growing at the base of that follicle now that the follicle is closed this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen so once the covering gets closed there is no more oxygen the bacteria wakes up and it has all this great food its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it and now its got an abundance of food supplies so it starts to flourish and that can look like a pimple so when you pick at it what you do is you create an inflammatory response which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar and more likely to come back in the same spot so picking is very bad but your dermatologist can help extract that for you or give you a treatment like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely,['acne'],1

why would a rn choose not to get her kids a flu shot as the grandparent is there anything i can do,did she give you any specific reason if it is a time issue maybe you can volunteer to take your grandchildren to a nearby pharmacy or health department to get the shots or is she worried about its safety would it help to give her some stats from the cdc on vaccine safety and flu here is something that may help <link> there are myths that persist about flu shots my mother refuses to get one because she thinks it will give her the flu and no amount of discussion from me will convince her otherwise remember that kids especially those under 5 are more susceptible to the flu so it is great that you are trying to talk to her about this remember that ultimately it is her decision as the parent and good luck with your presuasion skills,['flu'],1

i have erythrophobia the fear of blushing what can i do,when still working at the muhammad ali center about 10 years ago i asked one of my fellows dr holly shill to look at our pd population change from diagnosis to 25 years first thing i want you to notice is that 25 year range she found after looking at the unified parkinson is disease rating scale in more than 600 patients and 3 000 office visits several important things 1 diagnosis of pd usually occurred at a score of about 25 2 levodopa produced about a 12 point benefit a dopamine agonist about an 8 point benefit 3 patients with prominent tremor did better than patients with no tremor we did not look at gait specifically but we did look at disability  which we defined as 12 hours of effort to get 8 hours of pay this had nothing to do with a need for a walker or wheelchair on average people reached this point or a score around 60 at an average of 12 2 years after diagnosis i am sorry i cannot give you an average duration to a need for assistance with walking but hope that 12 years to retirement is good news,['erythrophobia (the fear of blushing)'],-1
can cigarette residue on fingers or mouth cause vaginal bacterial or yeast infection through oral or digital sex,hi done some very quick research on an idea just google these does nicotine cause bv does nicotine cause yeast infections now under this last one found you this but most of the info is from smoking <link> tobacco use when caused by the use of tobacco yeast infections can occur in anyone the reason that tobacco use increases the risk of oral thrush is that it alters the chemistry of your mouth allowing the candida bacteria to move into a position of power your mouth is already a prime area as far as candida is concerned because in is generally both warm and moist the skin in some parts of your mouth is also very thin allowing candida better access to the supplies of nutrients hidden just below the surface generally your helper bacteria and immune system can stave off candida infection but if you do something like chew tobacco smoke or just generally practice poor dental hygiene you could be helping to swing the balance in the direction of the bacteria if you have dentures you are at a particularly high risk of developing oral thrush particularly if the dentures do not fit well and if you also use tobacco yeast infections are very likely to develop perhaps this will help better good luck,['finger' 'mouth' 'vagina' 'bacterium' 'yeast infection'],1
one of my testices has always been larger but recently it has grown much larger and hurts dull pain so i have always had a larger testicle the right one and that has never been an issue but over the past 2 months it has grown far larger roughly double the original size i am going in for tests in about a week so my real question is that what else besides testiclar cancer coud be causeing this trying to stay possitive and hoping its nothing that serious also the pain has come and gone in the past but for no more than a day in the past but the last two weeks it has hurt fairly constantly,myopathy simply means “something wrong with a muscle” or more often multiple muscles myopathy is a very general term that can be applied to almost any condition affecting muscles some examples of myopathies include muscle inflammation caused by cholesterol lowering drugs called statins cardiomyopathy or poor function of the heart muscle genetic conditions resulting in severe birth defects affecting muscles autoimmune conditions affecting muscles like dermatomyositis there are many more conditions in the category of myopathy which vary widely in their causes treatments and prognosis all forms of myopathy can cause muscle weakness,['pain' 'testicle'],-1
i am getting dizzy when i eat sugar and my legs also feel numb  i am just under 57 and weigh 130 lbs i am 18 and just came to college and i have had really bad allergies i go to washington state university in pullman wa i have also been sick the majority of the time i have been here i have had multiple colds and had the flu once i have been here since august and my eating habits have gotten worse but i have not gained weight i am starting to feel dizzy when i eat sugary foods and my legs sometimes feel numb i also have to urinate frequently,rosacea is a very interesting condition we sometimes also call it adult acne but it is really two different things so the thing about rosacea is that you do have some control there are environmental stimuli that can trigger rosacea so it is important to know what can turn it on and then we can figure out how to turn it off as well triggers for rosacea tend to be extremes in temperature so if you go from a very hot environment to a very cold environment or vice versa that can be an extreme trigger for rosacea probably the biggest trigger for rosacea is alcohol and it can be any type of alcohol but some people notice it more with red wine also stress can be a very big trigger for rosacea so you have to manage your stress obviously we can not live without stress because life would be no fun at all but you have to be able to moderate your stress so that you can handle it better and so it will not show in your skin once you have that under control as much as possible then you can look for products that are fragrance free and dye free because anything that irritates your skin can also bring out rosacea so that will be a great starting point if that alone does not help then you might have to go to prescription type products that can help i like retinoids for treatment of rosacea but you have to do it very gently topical metronidazole in a prescription form can also be very helpful and salt based medicines can be very helpful one other trigger for rosacea can be spicy foods then some people have their own personal triggers some people will say chocolate is a trigger or vinegar or some vegetables so you have to sort of know your own personal triggers as well and try to avoid them hello you did not say if you we are a man or woman but i have rosacea and i have found that murad products have helped me a great deal i rarely ever have a breakout now unless i am in the sun a lot the murad that i use is essential c day moisturizer broad spectrum spf30pa +++ orange lettering second i use murad invisiblur perfecting shield broad spectrum spf 30 pa +++ this is purple lettering i do not need any of the other products so i do not use them as they are very expensive also after using the inviiblur perfecting shield i found that i no longer need any makeup or powder on my face other then lipstick and eye liner good luck,['urination' 'leg' 'dizziness' 'food' 'weight gain'],-1

can a mother with autism raise a child,by 5 months many but not all  babies are ready to sleep through the night but many need a little nudging if you would like to help this process along you will probably have to address three issues 1 get more calories in during the day by nursing more frequently and introducing complementary foods like rice cereal 2 help your baby realize that he can fall asleep on his own he should be put down awake at bedtime for at least a little while to give him a chance to learn that he can fall asleep on his own 3 if you are still in the same bedroom consider moving him out to his own place the two of you may be reacting to little noises each other is making helping to keep both of you awake not all families are ready for these sleep training steps at 5 months but if sleeping through the night is a priority skill you would like your son to learn you can do it,['autism'],-1
